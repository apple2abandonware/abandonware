In starting Empire of the Over-Mind within a few short steps you are on
a forest path with a red planet overhead, relishing the choice between a
mountain trail and a cave. Adventure stretches out before you, forty
characters of text per line, or maybe sixty. As in all text adventures,
that particular stretch of forest path in Empire of the Over-Mind may
become over-familiar before you get yourself to the right place with the
right items to travel finally to the red planet.

Empire of the Over-Mind departs from typical text adventures, though, in
its movement. Cardinal directions are not used. Instead, one references
the avenue of movement: the road, door, or even cliff-face which leads
to the next location. Also unusual is the ability to look ahead -- e.g.
down the road -- and see what is there before moving. The objects you
see ahead can vary from game to game: sometimes the key glints
enticingly while the skeleton hides in the shadows, other times you can
only see the key if you bravely confront the skeleton. Menacing though
the perils are, your mistakes are gently handled: even the crocodile
only "clobbers" you.

Typical of the era, the parser handles two-word verb-object
combinations, or three words if an adjective is needed. Depending on the
platform, item locations can vary from start to start, and getting
clobbered means you have to hunt them all down again. Necessary clues
are hidden in a long, printed poem which comes with the game. Avalon
Hill's instructions are a fascinating artifact themselves. Besides the
profoundly basic level -- covering the "prompt character," the
back-space key, and the exigencies of programming in 48K or less -- a
memory map is offered. No simple "Save" command or hotkey here: a little
assembly language saves the game state.
