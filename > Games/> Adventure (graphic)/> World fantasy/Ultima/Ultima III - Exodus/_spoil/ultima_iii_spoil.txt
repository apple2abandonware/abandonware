   Because of the structure of the exodus program, it fits into the
catagory of action-adventure. It's not a true arcade game, nor is it
a true adventure, more like a combo. Of both. The prvents us from writing
this tutorial in the normal format. Instead, it will just have all of
the clues needed to solve the game.

  Moon Doors:
 
  The Moon Doors take you to many places throughout Sorsaria.
each door has 3 trajectories, or, takes you to 3 different places...
  When a Moon Door appears, note the positions of the 2 moons [2 #'s on the
top of the screen] if you press space, these numbers will
change 3 times, then the door will then disappear.... Depending on the position
of the 2 moons, you will be transported to different areas:

SOLVE SECTION:
 
  To find the city of Dawn, stand on top of Lord British's castle,
and move west-8 and then south-35 and press <space> until the two
#'s on the top of the screen are both 0's... Then type 'E'nter.
 
  Ambrosia, the lost continent. Get a frigate, find the whirlpool.
run into it and wait a minute, it will say you died, but you don't!!!
be sure to take at least 4 key into ambrosia as the only way to get out is
to capture a boat, and sail to a lock and unlock it.
  The 4 shrines can be found in the land of ambrosia: strength in the
south west; dexterity in the south-east; intelligence in the north-west;
and wisdom in the north-east.
  When you are at the 4 shrines, be sure to type 'O'ther, then 'SEARCH' as
you will find the cards of sol, moons, death, and love there....
 
   How to get a boat:
When you see a pirate ship on the shore move up right next to it, if you
can win the battle, the ship is yours!
 
  To get the marks of fire, force, snake, and king, go to the dungeon of
fire it is surrounded on 3-sides by lava; to get there, go south-east along
the coast from lord british's castle; the dungeon is hidden in a dark forest
when you come across: there is hot spot on the wall. Who will touch?
you have found 1 of the marks.
 
 Here is what each of the marks let you do:
 
  Mark of Kings_____Lets you gain more levels + h.p.
  Mark of Fire______Walk through lava without taking any damage.
  Mark of Snake_____Lets you pass by the earth serpent.
  Mark of Force_____Walk throught a force-field w/o taking any damage.
 
   Exotics: the weapons of ultimate good
   The Exotic weapons can be found on one of the islands up near the city of
fawn.... Just get on one and type 'o' [for other command] then 'dig'.
if it says 'not here!' move on to the next <square> or next island as the
case may be....
   The Exotic armour can be found on one of the islands in the bay which is
located south-west of where you are now... Repeat the above commands.
 
  Now, we suggest that you just run around and gain levels and go get your
h.p. From lord british until you have a fair amount of hit points
[I suggest about 6-10 thousand; I promise, you'll need it..]
 
   Once you have become familiar with sorsaria, combat, fighting, and the
like, remember: know thy enemy!! Be sure to always talk to the people
in towns as they tell you a lot.
 
 
The Quest:
 
   With exotic weapons and armour on all of your men, board your frigate
and begin thy final quest....
 
   Sail up to the earth serpent that is blocking the entrance to the
port and 'y'ell [what?] 'evocare' you and your party will be transported
on the other side of the snake.
  Now, move up to the castle and then exit your craft; 'e'nter
 
  Once inside the castle you should go straight up until you see a monster,
from there go either left or right into the moving lava. [Note: do not go up
to where you see a forcefield and a guard as that passage just loops around
and comes back out at the entrance]
 
  as soon as you pass the lava you will be attacked by either: dragons
or wyverns or griffon... Beware! These monsters can hurl a blast all
the way across the arena!!
 
  after you dispose of them, go over and up a ways, you will encounter
another group of dragons, after killing them, keep going north and you will
encounter some balrons [or devils of some sort]. Kill these and continue
north.. Have you noticed that there are explosions all around you? Watch
out! They can hit you and do great damage!! Also be aware:
 
 time cannot be stopped in the castle
 
so do not bother using a powd or a altair spell as it will not work!!!
 
  now, keep going north, you should encounter another group of dragons
[what's their deal with dragons??] anyway, kill these suckers and go
east [if you went east from the monster at the entrance, go west]
 
  you will see some writing on the wall below you: death [pay no heed]
 
  now, go straight up into the lava... You will soon see a rectangular
object with many moving colors... That is exodus! Exodus is a machine!!
 
  but! Before you step any closer, beware! The floors upon which he lies
are alive and will attack you! There are 4 groups of them, you cannot
see them so do this once in combat mode
 
    move all of your players to this position:
 
      p1    p2    p3    p4
 
and wait.. As soon as one of you gets hit, start attacking with your exotic
weapons [you did remember to bring enough for all 4 of you didn't you?]
 
  after you kill all of the floors, move up to exodus, don't worry,
he's only a machine and cannot attack you, yet....
 
            exodus
          is four as
             is 1
 
    [this is only text so don't expect a master piece]
 
          x x x x   <- exodus
   you -> @
 
  move up to the top left hand corner of him/it and type: 'o'ther
[it will say what command] type: 'insert' [did you bring the cards?]
 
 then it will ask:
 
     s, m, l, d ?
 
 type: L      [for love]
**warning** If you hit anyother letter it will take away <<all>>
of your h.p. repeat the above, but this time you need to move over
1 space to the right and then:
 type: S      [for sol]
again move over to the right 1 space and insert the card of...
 type: M      [for moons]
at last, one move more to the right and insert:
 type: D      [for death to exodus]
 
 
   ...And so it came to pass that on this day, Exodus, hell-born incarnate
of evil was vanquished from Sorsaria.
