Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or
Adventure) is a text adventure game, developed originally in 1975, by
Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in
1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations
on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.

Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction
and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for
the adventure game genre.
