HOW TO LOAD DANGER IN DRINDISTI

Boot up your HELLFIRE WARRIOR disk following the loading instructions
that came with your game. At the point where the computer asks you if
you want to re-enter a saved level, answer "y". You will be asked to
insert the disk with the saved level. At this time, insert DANGER IN
DRINDISTI and press the "Return" key. Enter a level number between 6 and
9 and hit the "Return" key. You are now ready to begin play.


NOTE: The order of difficulty for DANGER IN DRINDISTI is as follows:
Level 7, Level 6, Level 9, Level 8. This sequence is necessary to take
advantage of having no room numbers displayed on Levels 6 and 8 (a
feature of the original Hell re Warrior program). We strongly suggest
that you play the game in this order.
