1. INTRODUCTION

Europe Ablaze is a simulation of aerial warfare in World War II.
Each player, and there can be as many as twelve or as few as none, takes on
the role of Air Force Commander-in-Chief or Air Fleet Commander.  Those
positions not assumed by human players are controlled by the computer.

An intact game of Europe Ablaze should contain an album, a map card, a menu
card, a Design Manual, a Player's Manual, a strip of save game labels and a
game disk.

If this isn't the case, let us know.  We'll replace defective or missing
components immediately.  Please return defective materials to us.

2. THE TUTORIALS
----------------
The following tutorials will ease you into the game by gently introducing you
to the menu structure and the range of activities available to you as a
commander.

Once the menu structure and its manipulation have become familiar, you've
mastered the game - really!  This shouldn't take anymore than 15-20 minutes.
After that its just a matter of gaining experience in World War II air
operations - this may take a bit longer!

There are three levels of command represented in Europe Ablaze, two of which
are playable by humans.  The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) furthers his nations
war aims by translating directives from the Supreme Command (always the
computer) into operational objectives and procedures to be used by his
subordinate Air Fleets.  The Air Fleet Commander directs the various squadrons
under his control to achieve these objectives.

Start up the disk using the procedure for your computer as given on the menu
card.

The menu window on the right of the screen will show the same information as
Menu A in the Start Menus.

Tutorial 1 - The C-in-C
-----------------------
Type (RET) until the cursor is positioned on the <GAME> line and then type
(Y)(RET).  The scenario menu (Menu E) appears.  Type (RET) until the cursor is
positioned on the <Scen 1> line (the Their Finest Hour scenario) and then type
(Y)(Ret).  The player menu (Menu F) appears.

The screen displays the list of available commands and their controllers.  The
default value is human.

In this tutorial you will take the role of the Axis C-in-C, Reichsmarschall
Hermann Goering.  Position the cursor on the <EDIT> line in the menu window and
type (Y)(RET).

The cursor is flashing on the <GOERING> line and you may replace his name with
your own if you wish.  Type (RET) and the cursor moves to the <N> to the right
of Goering's name.  As this is your role in the scenario, we'll leave it as it
is; i.e. human controlled.

Type (RET) until the cursor is on the <N> to the right of the <LUFTFLOT 5> line
then type (Y)(RET).  As you can see, Luftflotte 5 is now under computer control
.  If you make a mistake and move the cursor in the opposite direction.  Using
the same method, place the remaining two Axis Air Fleet Commanders and all the
Allied Commanders under computer control.

Once this is done, type (ESC/f1) to go back to the player menu.  Position the
cursor on the <START> line and type (Y)(RET).

Examine the game menus card.  Menu 4 is on the screen.  This is the C-in-C menu
and is accessed only at midnight; i.e. the C-in-C issues orders once per day
and then sits back and watches the action.

There are no <RECORDS> as yet so there's not much point in viewing those
screens.  See Chapter 4 at a later date for more information.

Use the arrow key to position the cursor over the <WEATHER> line and type (RET)
.  More detail is available for weather areas in friendly territory as
evidenced by the precise cloud and wind levels.  Storms are likely in the
highlighted areas.  Weather estimates for enemy territory are less reliable.

About the only areas to make suitable bombing targets are the central and south
-eastern parts of England.  The poor weather over France may ground the bulk of
your operations but, since this is an introductory tutorial and no-one is
keeping score, we'll get stuck in anyway.

More information on the weather system is available in Chapter 4 as well as the
Design Manual.

Type (ESC/f1) to go back to Menu 4.

The most important part of the C-in-C's job is issuing orders to his Air Fleet
Commanders.  Position the cursor over the <ORDERS> line and type (RET).

The command display for LUFTFLOTTE 5 appears on the screen.  The arrow keys
will cycle between the 3 German commands.  We'll leave LUFTFLOTTE 5 to the
last since it's the least important command.

Use the arrow keys to select LUFTFLOTTE 2.  Your current victory point total
(score) appears above the menu window.  It's negative to begin with as
explained in Chapter 5 but don't worry about this now.  A summary of the
operational squadrons assigned to LUFTFLOTTE 2 appears below the menu window.

The threshold value is the number of points which the Commander of LUFTFLOTTE
2 must accrue before he contributes positive victory points to his C-in-C.  His
current score appears below this number.

Basically, you get points for successfully bombing your objectives and
destroying enemy aircraft one way or another.

Now on to issuing orders and, if your Air Fleet Commanders are human,
weathering their endless storm of abuse, pleading and whining.

It's August 10th, 1940 and the Battle of Britain is about to begin in earnest.
LUFTFLOTTEN 2 and 3 are your main striking forces and we'll give them similar
orders.

Type (RET) and the cursor will appear to the right of the <Priority> line.
We'll enter all the orders before explaining their significance.  Type (7)(RET)
(0)(RET) (2)(RET) (N)(RET) (Y)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (Y)(RET) (N)(RET)
(Y)(RET) (Y)(RET) (Y)(RET) (Y)(RET).

The high priority will increase the likelihood of available replacements going
to LUFTFLOTTE 2.  No missions are allocated since the objectives for the
moment are primarily tactical targets such as airfields and radar stations.
Missions are more suited to strategic operations and are covered in detail in
Chapter 4.  The high activity level ensures maximum aircraft availability.  In
bad weather, it's usually more prudent to order an activity level of 0 and give
everyone a good rest.

We have ordered LUFTFLOTTE 2 to launch their attacks in daylight, to press home
the attack in spite of fighter opposition and not to use their fighters as
close escorts for their bombers.  Please see Chapter 4 for a detailed treatment
of fighter escort doctrine.

The multiplier next to each target type (more or less) indicates the relative
victory point award for bombing it.  By entering (N) for population and
communications targets, we have prevented LUFTFLOTTE 2 from accessing the
routines for bombing these.  Your subordinates cannot disobey you!

That's it for LUFTFLOTTE 2.

Type (ESC/f1) and the use the arrow keys to select LUFTFLOTTE 3.  Enter the
same orders as you did for LUFTFLOTTE 2.

Type (ESC/f1) and then use the arrow keys to select LUFTFLOTTE 5.  Type (3)
(RET) (0)(RET) (0)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET)
(N)(RET) (N)(RET) (N)(RET) (Y)(RET).

In other words, LUFTFLOTTE 5 has been given a minor role.

When you have finished issuing orders, type (ESC/f1) to go back to Menu 4.

The final menu for which the C-in-C has responsibility is <FLAK>.  This is the
mechanism by which anti-aircraft gun assets are relocated to meet enemy attacks
.  There's no need to use it now.  Consult Chapter 4 at your leisure for the
details of its operation.

Type (ESC/f1) and you are asked whether you wish to end the C-in-C phase.  This
is an irrevocable decision and once made you will not be able to influence the
game for another 24 hours.  Position the cursor on the <YES> line and type
(RET).

Menu H (the Game Master) is on the screen.  You cannot give any orders here
since this menu is for the use of Air Fleet Commanders. (You can access Menu 10
- the Combat Display - but see Chapter 4 before you try it.)

Position the cursor on the <RUN> line and type (Y)(RET).

The game is set in progress and will run without interruption for 24 hours
unless you tell the clock to stop by typing (ESC/f1).  Do this if the action
gets really hot and then use <RUN 5> rather than <RUN>.  This allows you to
observe the battle in single 5 minute increments.

At 0000 hours on August 11th, the C-in-C routine will be accessed again.  Have
a look at your records (Chapter 4 will tell you what everything means), see
what's happened to the weather and then issue whatever orders you think
appropriate.

We recommend you continue this exercise for 3-4 days.  It won't take you very
long and it will give you a good general feel for the way the game runs.

Tutorial 2 - Air Fleet Commander
--------------------------------
Start up your computer to get Menu A on the screen.  Select the Their Finest
Hour scenario again and make all positions computer controlled except
LUFTFLOTTE 5 - this will be your job.  Select <START> from Menu F and Menu H
(the Game Master) will appear.

Select Menu 9 via Menu 1.  The only Axis command which can be accessed is
<COM 1>; the other two are computer controlled.

Select Menu 11.  This is the midnight/mid-day interphase menu.  All offensive
operations are planned at this time.

During the midnight interphase, only day trained squadrons are available for
assignment.  During the mid-day interphase, only night trained squadrons are
available for assignment.  The computer knows this and won't let you get the
two mixed up.

The strategic map has been replaced by a summary of the orders issued to you
by Reichsmarschall Goering.  The <Threshold> value is the number of victory
points you must achieve before you can contribute positively to your C-in-C's
performance.  Your score to date is 0.

From the summary below the menu window you can see your force consists of just
9 squadrons (or Gruppen if you wish to use the German word) which makes it
ideal for tutorial purposes!  You have 1 light bomber, 6 medium bombers, 1
single engine fighter and 1 twin engine fighter.

Your <Priority> will be between 2-4, almost certainly no missions will be
allocated to you and your activity level will be either 0 or 1.  Have a look
at Chapter 4 for full details on activity at a later date.

You'll probably be given <Resolute Attack> orders; which is a pity, since your
men are probably not up to it.  Still, everyone must do their duty.

There are no <RECORDS> to look at yet, but it's always important to consult
your weather report.  Select <WEATHER> and you'll find the prediction to be
execrable.  Have a look at the map card.  Our area of operations is north of
Hull.  Even with the bad weather, we may still be able to annoy the Brits.

Before launching our ops we'll look at the remaining interphase menus.

Select <SQUADS> then <STATUS>.  None of our squadrons have been stood down as
would be the case if they were tired and/or depleted.  None are as yet assigned
to operations.  Note that squadron skills are given in the bottom display.
Thus, of our 9 squadrons, 7 are trained for daylight operations and 2 are
trained for night operations.  The 2 night trained squadrons will not be
available for assignment until the mid-day interphase.  The specialist training
skills are pathfinder, navel and recon.  A given squadron can possess any
number of these specialist skills.

Let's have a detailed look at our squadrons.  Select <RUN-TIME> the <REPORTS>.
Every squadron is listed according to its current status.  Since we haven't
given any orders yet and none of our men are stood down, all our squadrons can
be examined by selecting <AVAILABLE>.

Use the arrow keys to cycle through the squadrons until you come to 1/ZG76.
It's based at Sola as shown by the flashing cursor on the strategic map, the
plane type is the Messerschmidt Bf 110C (Zerstorer), it's a twin engine fighter
, its crew are fresh, veterans and some 20 of 26 aircraft are operational.  It
has no specialist skills.

Go back to Menu 11 and select <TARGETS>.  The locations of all recons, sweeps,
raids and missions planned for the day by your brother Air Fleet Commanders,
Feldmarschalls Kesselring and Sperrle, can be examined.

Type (RET) to activate each selection.  Note that missions flown to any centre
facility will display the population symbol, regardless of the actual target
type.

Computer controlled Air Fleet Commanders always issue their orders first so
this screen is very useful for co-ordinating operations with them.

That's it for the preliminaries, it's time to get on the phone and drag your
squadron ops officers out of their bunks.  Go back to Menu 11 and select <OPS>.
Menu 12 (the Strike Ops Menu) appears.

Because of the bad weather, we'll not risk too many casualties.  For today,
we'll assign 1 squadron to recon, 1 squadron to shipping lane harassment, 1
squadron to 1 sneak port raid and 1 fighter squadron to a standing patrol over
our own shipping lanes to keep Coastal Command honest.  During the mid-day
interphase, we'll send 1 of our night trained squadrons on a 'gardening'
(minelaying) operation.

As a general practice, it's best to issue order to your specialist squadrons
first.  this way you won't waste their skills.

Select <RECON> from Menu 12.  Note that complete details on all strike
assignments are provided in Chapter 4 and they should be consulted at a later
date.

The first step is to select a target centre.  Recon operations are flown
throughout the day by elements of a squadron and will gather information on
the chosen centre as well as other centres within 3 hexes of it.

All Allied centres are identified on the strategic map and the arrow keys are
used to cycle the national cursor through them.  Select a centre which has a
recon value of <none> in the vicinity of Sunderland, the type (RET).  A target
symbol appears over the chosen centre and the cursor moves to the location of
the squadron identified in the right hand column.  This squadron is trained
for recon ops as shown in its data display.  Normally, the arrow keys will
cycle you through all the recon squadrons available.  In this case, however,
you've only got one so there's nowhere to cycle to!

Type (RET) to select 1/121F for the job.  The squadron is now briefing for its
operation.  To confirm the assignment, type (ESC/f1) and recover Menu 12.  To
abort the assignment, type (RET) and answer the prompt.

Once you have confirmed the assignment and recovered Menu 12 it's too late to
change your mind.  The committed squadron is no longer available for selection;
i.e. select <RECON> again and you'll be informed there are no available
squadrons.

Select <HARASS> from Menu 12.  There is a chance that Goering has ordered you
not to attack shipping lanes.  If this is the case, we'll postpone the
harassment operation until tomorrow.  Otherwise, position the cursor on the
<SEA L> line and type (Y)(RET).

Enemy shipping lanes appear on the strategic map and all you have to do is
select a squadron for the assignment.  harassments are flown throughout the day
by elements of the squadron, the particular target being decided at the time of
take-off by the squadron commander.  Select 1/KG30 at Aalberg.  Type (RET) to
brief the operation, then (ESC/f1) to confirm it.

Select <RAID> from Menu 12.  Raids are flown by a full squadron at a particular
target and require an approach altitude and ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival).
Select <PORTS> and type (Y)(RET).

Enemy ports appear on the strategic map and you should use the arrow keys to
locate Edinburgh, an undamaged minor port.

Type (RET) then use the arrow keys to locate 3/KG26 at Stavenger.  Type (RET),
set an approach altitude of 1000ft, advance the ETA from 0240 hours to 0630
hours (i.e. daylight) and the squadron is now <Briefing>.  The details of the
assignment appear at the bottom of the display and if they're correct, type
(ESC/f1) to confirm them.

The new altitude, combined with the bad weather, may allow us to sneak in
under the British radar screen; if not we've got problems.  There's not a lot
of room at this altitude for your parachute to open.

We're ready to go.  Standing patrols are not offensive operations so they can
be mounted at any time.

Type (ESC/f1) until you get back to Menu H.  Select <RUN> and type (Y)(RET).

Nothing much should happen before daylight.  Stop the game around 0500 hours;
i.e. type (ESC/f1).  Select Menu 9 and type (Y)(RET) to obtain Menu 18 (the
Run-Time Ops Select menu).

We will now mount a patrol over our shipping lanes.  Select <PATROL> and type
(RET).  Select <SEALane> and type (RET).  Friendly shipping lanes are
identified on the strategic map.  Use the arrow keys to position the national
cursor over shipping lane 53N.  Note that density refers to the importance of
the shipping lane and therefore the likelihood of locating targets there.  The
maximum density is 7.  The tactical map below the menu window identifies the
exact hex.

Type (RET) to fix the patrol area then the arrow keys to locate 2/JG77, a
Bf 105E fighter squadron.  Type (RET) again to select the squadron, set a
patrol altitude of 12,000 ft (for a detailed treatment of the importance of
altitude in air operations, see Chapter 4), set the ETA to 0600 hours and type
(Y) for the <STAND> line.  Standing patrols will keep elements of the
squadron on station from ETA until nightfall (or sunrise for night trained
fighters).  Full squadron patrols will place the entire squadron on station
from ETA until their endurance runs out.  Use standing patrols unless you
expect an imminent, large scale attack.

patrols are active in the station hex and the 6 hexes adjacent to it.

Recover Menu H and select <RUN>.  Around daylight the action will begin to
hot up.  As all the Allied commanders are computer controlled, only sightings
of Allied aircraft by Axis radar/observer corps will interrupt the game.  Axis
aircraft will visible at all times.

From here on you're on your own.  If any Allied aircraft are sighted near your
theatre, use either of your fighter squadrons to intercept them.  Chapter 4
gives full details of this procedure.  During the mid-day interphase, remember
to assign a night trained squadron to harass shipping lanes.


3. USING THE GAME MENU
======================
Having played through the introductory tutorials you have, we hope, discovered
how easy the game menus are to operate.  They can be divided into 4 types.

(a) Branch Menus - These menus signpost the route to other menus. [1,4,9,11,12,
                   14,16,18,21] Note that those menus identified in bold face
                   also provide some information.
(b) Information Menus - These menus provide information on the various forces
                        and functions in the game. [7,8,15,17,22,23]
(c) Action Menus - These menus are the centre of the game system.  All of the
                   orders used in the game are given through them. [5,6,13,19,
                   20]
(d) Single Function Menus - [2,3,10]


4. THE GAME MENUS
=================

Menu 1 (Nationality Select)
---------------------------
This is a branch menu and is used to select Axis or Allied forces.  If either
nationality is completely computer controlled, then this menu is bypassed and
menus 4 or 9 will be obtained directly from menu H.

Menu 2 (Save Game Utility)
--------------------------
This single function menu is described on the Start Menu Card.

Menu 3 (End Game Utility)
-------------------------
This single function menu permits a human player to finish a game earlier than
the established scenario end point.

Menu 4 (C-in-C)
---------------
At midnight, and only at midnight, this branch menu is accessed whenever a
human is acting as the C-in-C of either nationality.  It is used by the C-in-C
to review his reports, issue orders to his Air Fleet commanders and to redeploy
flak assets as he sees fit.

Menu 5 (Flak Adjustment)
------------------------
This is an information/action menu.  Only the C-in-C has access to this menu
and the authority to redeploy the available flak assets.  consider Fig. 1.

Flak unit A43 is identified by the German cursor.  Its hex location is shown
in the segment of the tactical map appearing under the menu window; i.e. the
block cursor indicates the exact hex position.  The arrow keys are used to
cycle through each flak unit.

The top two lines of text above the menu window display information pertaining
to the flak unit.  The text displays the unit's ID Code and whether it is
point or area flak.  Batteries with fewer than 20 guns are classified as point
flak and can only engage enemy aircraft flying into or through the hex they
occupy.  Larger batteries are classified as area flak and, in addition to the
capabilities of point flak, a proportion of the battery may engage enemy
aircraft flying into or through an adjacent hex.

The next two lines of text display the number of guns in reserve and the
number of them which can be allocated to flak units.  Flak units themselves
don't move so that in order to reorganize your flak forces you must allocate
guns from the reserve to those flak units you wish to reinforce.  The supply
value is the maximum number of guns which may be allocated to flak units each
day.

Guns withdrawn from flak units become available for re-allocation on the
following day.  There is no limit to the number of guns which can be withdrawn
on a particular day, except that the total number of guns in reserve may not
exceed 255.  Note, however, the supply value is calculated by summing 1/32 of
the total guns deployed plus 1/8 of the guns currently in reserve and comparing
this number to the number of guns in reserve.  The lower value is that day's
supply value.  The significance of this mechanism is simply to make frantic
redeployment of AA assets most inefficient.

A limited number of AA guns are added to the reserve as re-inforcements each
day, the exact number being principally dependent upon the current situation;
i.e. the more desperate the defense, then the more AA guns will arrive.

In addition to the AA fire of these heavy batteries, all targets have some
light AA capability which is determined by the computer and applied against
enemy aircraft where appropriate.

To alter the size of a flak unit, position the cursor over the chosen battery
and type (RET).  The message <enter AA adjusted value> appears below the menu
window.  Enter any value between 0 and the listed maximum, then type (RET) to
complete the adjustment.  Regardless of other factors, no flak unit may contain
more than 255 guns.

Menu 6 (Issue Orders)
---------------------
This is the C-in-C's principal action menu.  It is used to rank his commanders'
priorities, assign missions, choose a level of operational activity, determine
doctrine for each command and to regulate target selection.

The arrow keys are used to locate each command.  In fig 2, the Axis C-in-C has
selected Luftflotte 2.

At the top of the screen the commander's performance to date is displayed.  The
difference between score and threshold is the number of victory points
currently awarded to the commander.  Note that the number of VP's currently
awarded to the C-in-C appears in the second line of text above the menu window.
This second VP number may be negative.

                             Fig 2

Assigning Priority.  A priority between 0-7 must be assigned to each command.
The number displayed on the right of the <Priority> line is the value entered
last turn (or the value set at the beginning of the scenario).  The commander's
priority determines the likelihood of receiving replacement aircraft.  Note
that if all commands are given the same priority, then available replacements
will be more or less divided equally between commands; i.e. altering priorities
does not increase the number of replacements available, it merely changes their
distribution.  Note that the priority assigned to each command at the beginning
of a scenario is used to determine the operational readiness of the command.

Allocating Missions.  The C-in-C must assign a number of missions to each
command.  The range of values allowed is 0-5, which may be over-ridden by the
total missions available as prescribed by the scenario.  The text below the
menu window summarizes the number of operable squadrons available to the
command for that day and is a useful guide to assigning missions, especially
for inexperienced players.  Note that these numbers may change when the
Activity Level is adjusted.  As a general rule, you should assign one mission
for every 8-15 medium or heavy bomber squadrons on hand.  Note that exhausted
squadrons, and those with less than 25% of their official establishment, are
always stood-down and therefore inoperable.

Furthermore, missions may only be directed against centres so don't waste
missions on a command which will be directed to attack other targets.

Activity Level.  Each command must be assigned a level of activity and, as with
missions, the number on the right of the <Activity> line is the previous day's
activity level.  There are three levels of activity.  Enter (0), (1) or (2) for
low, standard or high activity levels respectively.  Under low activity
conditions, only fresh and fit squadrons are kept available; all others are
stood-down.  Under standard activity conditions, tired and exhausted squadrons
are stood-down while for high activity, only exhausted squadrons are
stood-down.

Squadrons under stand-down orders are not available for operations (i.e. their
crews are off boozing in the local pub).  However, fatigue recovery and
aircraft repair are both considerably enhanced while a squadron is stood-down.

As a general rule, use the weather prediction in the fourth line of text above
the menu window as a guide to determine your level of activity for the day.  If
weather conditions are bad, select a low activity level and allow your men to
recuperate.

Day/Night Operations.  A (Y) or (N) should be entered on the <Night Operations>
line.  Every command is considered to be either a day command or a night
command.  This information comes from the scenario set up.  It is a major
decision to switch a command from a day role to a night role or vice versa.

When the decision is made to switch to a night role, certain squadrons in the
command will alter their squadron training status to night ops.  The exceptions
to this are -

(a) all squadrons already trained for night ops.
(b) all squadrons trained for naval ops.
(c) all squadrons with a crew size of three or fewer unless the plane type is
    night modified and
(d) all recon squadrons.

When the decision is made to switch to a day role, the reverse is true.

Throughout the course of the war, daylight bombing, even when escorted, usually
resulted in unacceptably high bomber losses.  The only exceptions to this were
the operations of the US 8th and 15th Air Forces.  A combination of
exceptionally tough and durable bombers, high-performance, long-range escorts
and a clear numerical superiority were all needed to achieve this phenomenon.
More usually, air forces were forced by mounting losses to switch to night
bombing operations with the consequent drop in accuracy (and results).

What this means is don't switch a night command to a day command unless you
enjoy the advantages possessed by the US in 1944-45.  Furthermore, be prepared
to go to night bombing when your losses start to outweigh you bombing
performance.  This is an especially bitter pill for Germany in 1940 as bombing
accuracy at night is woeful once the British have jammed out the beam
navigation.

Squadrons which switch to night ops (and vice versa) are not immediately
available in their new role.  A period of 1-3 days must pass before the
modifications and training are complete and the squadrons again ready for
operations.

Bombing Doctrine.  A (Y) or (N) should be entered on the <Resolute Attack>
line.  A resolute attack is an instruction to your bombers to press home the
assault in spite of heavy enemy resistance.  The alternative instruction will
result in fewer aircraft losses and fewer bombs dropped on the target.  For
example, Bomber Command in 1940-41 instructed its aircrews to abort operations
in the face of fighter opposition while the Luftwaffe issued the opposite
order.  Their aircrews were expected to hit the target regardless of enemy
presence.  It's only while conducting day operations that this decision is
important.  At night you can give resolute attack orders quite safely as the
chance of fighter interception is much lower.

Escort Doctrine.  A (Y) or (N) should be entered on the <Close Escort> line.
Commands which are made up primarily of bomber aircraft (i.e. type 2) are not
permitted to fly offensive patrols (sweeps) if they have been given a close
escort order.  Their fighters should be used for direct escorting of missions.
This decision should be made if bomber losses get out of proportion to the
results they achieve.  Night commands should never be given a close escort
order.

Target Regulation.  The final seven Y/N entries are used to regulate the
target types which may be attacked by the command.  A target type with an
(N) entry cannot be attacked by that command.  The multiplier column will
inform you of the current importance assigned to each target type by your
nation's supreme commander.  It is advisable to enter (Y) for the target types
with the higher multipliers, (N) for the others.  Keep in mind the number of
missions and level of activity accorded to the command when allocating
potential targets.  The Air Fleet Commander will not see the multipliers when
he is briefing his operations so be careful not to confuse him with too many
target selections.  On the other hand, you must give him sufficient flexibility
to have some chance of deceiving the enemy as to his intentions.

Menu 7 (Weather Report)
-----------------------
This is an information menu.  The strategic map is divided into 12 regions,
each region being given a predicted cloud cover and wind strength.

The exact wind and cloud values are given for areas in friendly territory.  A
generalized comment appears for those areas outside friendly territory.

Areas likely to be experiencing storms and/or fog are highlighted.  Further
information on the weather system is provided in the Design Manual.

Weather updates occur every twelve hours and are based on the weather forecast
(displayed above the menu window) and the time of year.

Fig 3 shows a typical weather report.

Menu 8 (Record Summary)
----------------------
This is an information menu.  There are four components to the Records display.
These menus are accessible by both C-in-C and Air Fleet Commanders.  Use the
arrow keys to cycle through them.

Aircraft Status.  This display provides a detailed breakdown of the status of
friendly aircraft as well as an estimate of enemy aircraft losses to date.
There is only one page to this report.  Consider fig 4.

Airfield Status.  This display provides information on damaged friendly
airfields.  The command to which they belong, their damage control rating and
the current damage level are shown.  The report will not appear unless there is
at least one damaged airfield.  There may be more than one page to this report;
use the arrow keys to select the next page.  See the end of this section for a
note on damage reporting for colour and black and white monitors.

Friendly Centre Status.  This display provides information on damaged friendly
centres.  The damage to each facility is reported separately.  At the beginning
of the scenario, this display is blank.  The report will not appear unless
there is at least one damaged centre.  There may be more than one page to this
report; use the arrow keys to select the next page.  See the end of this

Enemy Centre Status.  This display lists only those enemy centres against which
operations have been conducted to date.  At the beginning of the scenario, this
display is blank.  The information provided lists the reported damage sustained
by each facility in the enemy centre, its current recon state, the number of
sorties flown against it and the reported tonnage of bombs dropped on the
target.  (Note that each plane which completes and operation against a centre
is a sortie.)  There may be more than one page to this report; use the arrow
keys to select the next page.  See the end of this section for a note on
damage reporting for colour and black and white monitors.  Consider fig 5.

In this example, you can see that Swansea is a minor centre for population,
industry, communications and port.  It's current recon level is poor (1), 72
sorties have been flown against it to date and 64 tons of bombs have been
(reportedly) dropped on the target.  The communication facilities are reported
to be slightly damaged, the port facilities to be heavily damaged.  Population
and industry are as yet unaffected.  Similarly the port facilities in
Southampton are in ruin.

This example shows the way a black and white screen will appear.  The colour
bars on a colour monitor correspond to the four levels of damage. Green - none,
blue - slight, purple - heavy, brown - in ruins.

Menu 10 (Combat Display)
------------------------
This is a single function menu.  Selecting (Y) activates the combat display
mode.  The results of air-to-air combat, AA fire, bomb runs and radar sightings
initiated by a given side are displayed as they occur.

Either of both sides may activate the display.

Each component in the combat display can be activated independently of the
others.  Use the arrow keys to cycle through the four components in the menu
window then type (RET) to switch the display.  Consider fig 6.

We recommend you turn on all four components of the combat display for your
few games, especially while becoming familiar with the game mechanics.  After
that, however, turn off all but the radar detection display; you will add
heaps more suspense to the game.

(a) The intercept (Air to Air) Report - Axis and Allied aircraft involved in
a dog-fight are displayed in the right-hand column.  Both the number destroyed
(down) and the number damaged are reported.  Reports are accurate for aircraft
destroyed over friendly territory and less reliable for aircraft destroyed over
enemy territory.  Note that in the plane losses summary in Menu 8, all friendly
losses are accurate, enemy losses less so.

(b) The After Action Report (AAR) - This report displays the number of friendly
bomber sorties from a particular squadron which reach the target.  The number
of these aircraft destroyed or damaged by the light AA capability of the target
is given as is the number of crews who report a successful bombing mission.
Whether or not the bombing missions were actually successful is another matter.

(c) The Flak Report - First of all, don't confuse this report with the light AA
casualties inflicted by the target.  Flak (heavy AA) reports are given
whenever friendly flak units score (or think they score) against enemy
aircraft.

(d) The Sighting Report - This report appears whenever enemy aircraft are
detected by friendly ground radar installations or observer corps.  The
information is self-explanatory.

Menu 11 (0000/1200 Ops Select)
------------------------------
This branch menu is accessed at midnight and mid-day only.  It allows each Air
Fleet Commander to view his records, view the weather prediction for the next
12 hours, brief his operations, examine his squadrons, and review the
operations assigned to all forces belonging to his side.  The display screen
shows a summary of the orders given by the C-in-C.  It cannot be edited.  See
fig 7 for an example.

Menu 12 (Strike Ops Select)
---------------------------
This branch menu is used to determine the type of strike op to be flown against
the enemy.  The operations which can be conducted are defined as Recon, Sweep,
Harass, Raid and Mission.

Menu 13 (Set Strike Op)
-----------------------
These are the major action menus of the game.  They are used by Air Fleet
Commanders to put in motion all their (strike) offensive air operations.  They
are essentially similar to use although each has its particular purpose and
peculiarities.  Before explaining the procedure for launching each type of op,
we'll present a general description of each together with a guide for their
use.

Recon Ops.  The purpose of a reconnaissance operation is to update the
intelligence on enemy centres.  Strikes directed against centres on which
recent intelligence is available will have a greater chance of success.  There
are four levels of intelligence; good (3), fair (2), poor (1) and none (0).  The
intelligence report for each enemy centre appears in the four lines of text
above the menu window on the appropriate Set Strike Op displays.  A single
centre is selected and a squadron assigned to recon it.  Throughout the day,
elements of that squadron will take off to recon that centre together with
others centres within a three-hex radius of the target centre.  Only squadrons
trained for recon ops can be used for this purpose.  Recon ops should be flown
to an enemy centre on the day before a major operation is planned against it.

Sweeps.  These are offensive fighter patrols and are plotted in the same way
as raids.  A single squadron is detailed to sweep an enemy facility (at a
particular time and altitude).  It will fly to that location and patrol for
as long as its endurance holds out and then return to base.  Fighter and
fighter-bomber aircraft only may be assigned to this op.  They are best used
in conjunction with bombing ops, especially raids and harassments, to provide
some fighter protection.

Harass Ops.  Harassment operations are flown by elements of a squadron against
particular target types.  For example, a particular Stuka Squadron may be
assigned to harass enemy ports for the day.  During the day (or night if the
squadron is night trained), elements of that squadron will mount hit and run
strikes against the target type selected.  The aim of such ops, in addition to
the damage inflicted, is to create as much confusion as possible for the enemy
fighter controller.  Harassment ops may not be flown against population
centres.  They may be flown against any other target type approved by the
C-in-C.  Any squadron with a payload greater then 0 can fly this op.  They
are best used in conjunction with large scale raids and missions.

Raids.  Raids are flown by single squadrons against particular targets.  An
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) or Time Over Target (TOT) and an approach
altitude are set for each squadron.  They are the most suitable op for
dive-bombers and fighter-bombers as well as shorter ranged light and medium
bombers.  Any squadron other than recon squadrons with no payload may fly
raids. They should be flown in conjunction with fighter sweep ops wherever
possible.

Missions.  These are the most important air op in the game.  A number of
bomber squadrons, with or without an escort, are grouped together into a single
strike directed against a particular facility at an enemy centre.  A form up
point must be selected, one or two legs can be plotted and an ETA must be set.
There are two methods by which the squadrons to participate in the mission can
be selected, both of which are described later in this section.  The end
result, however, is the same.  The number of missions available to each command
is determined by the C-in-C and it is advisable to use every one of them,
weather permitting.  They cannot be used later.  They are the ideal means of
employment for long range, strategic bombers preferably coupled with high
performance, long range escort fighters.  Always include a pathfinder squadron
in the mission if one is available.  Any squadron which meets the range
requirement may be included in a mission.

Availability for Strike Ops.
Daylight strike ops are briefed during the midnight interphase and only day
trained squadrons are available for selection.  Similarly, night strike ops are
briefed during the mid-day interphase and only night trained squadrons are
available for selection.

Strike Op Procedures.
The procedure for launching a mission will be given first.  The other strike
ops are more or less shorter variants of the same technique.  For the purpose
of these explanations, all the examples below are from the Their Finest Hour
scenario, first day, midnight interphase.

Setting a Mission.  On selecting the <MISSION> line from Menu 11, you will be
presented with a screen similar to fig 8.  As instructed in the menu window,
the first step is to select a target type.

The display screen shows the strategic map upon which is super-imposed the
location of your Command's airfields.  Below the menu window are listed the
possible target types.  Note that airfields, radar stations and shipping lanes
are never available as mission targets, and that certain centre facilities
(in this example none) may also be denied as potential targets.

In this example we're going to select <POP'N> as the target type.  Position the
cursor on the <POP'N> line and type (Y)(RET).  The display screen now shows, in
addition to your Command's airfields, all enemy centres which have a population
level greater than 0.  The national cursor (in this case the German maltese
cross) appears over the first centre, Plymouth, as illustrated by fig 9.  The
four lines of text above the menu window provide information about the centre,
the text inside the menu window gives the weather prediction and the recon
level and the portion of the tactical map below the menu window shows the hex
location of the target centre.

In this example, the plan is to strike London.  Use the arrow keys to locate
London and type (RET).  The next step is to set a form up point for the
mission.  This point must be over friendly territory.  Use the I,J,K,M keys to
position the strategic cursor to the location shown in fig 10.

Note that the target centre, London, is now identified by a cute target symbol.
As a general rule, it's best to position your form up point somewhere around
the geographical centre of your airfield locations, especially for large
missions.  This way, no single squadron has too far to go to reach the form up
point.

Once the form up point is in position, type (RET).  An <F> appears inside the
strategic cursor and you are instructed to set a first leg.  This is not
compulsory.  You may type (RET) at this point and the course set for the
mission will be a straight line from the form up point to the target.  In this
example, we are going to plot a first leg.  Use the I,J,K,M keys to position
the strategic cursor in the location shown in fig 11 and type (RET).

The first leg is set, as indicated by the presence of a <1> inside the
strategic cursor, and we have the option of setting a second leg.  There is no
great need for a second leg in this example as, hopefully, the course plotted
will confuse the British fighter defenses into thinking we're headed for
Norwich or perhaps the Midlands.

Type (RET) and the strategic cursor disappears leaving the form up and first
leg points to indicate the projected course.  We must now set a Time Over
Target (or ETA) for the mission.  The default value is mid-day (1200 hrs) as
shown below the menu window.  (If we were setting the mission in the mid-day
interphase, the default value would be midnight.)

In this example we will select an ETA of 1000 hrs; i.e. we'll give the British
time to eat their muffins before we bomb them to bits.  Enter (10) and the
screen should look like fig 12.

Type (RET) to set the ETA and obtain the mission summary screen.  The strategic
map has been replaced by a text screen which details the availability or
otherwise of fighter and bomber squadrons.  Examine fig 13.

In this example, Luftflotte 2 has 23 bomber squadrons and 21 escort (fighter)
squadrons available for use in the mission.  All of the medium bombers can
carry a full payload to the target while the 2 dive bomber squadrons can only
carry a quarter payload.  There are no squadrons in the illegal (illg) column.
There are two reasons which can place an unassigned squadron in the illegal
column.  The first is insufficient range to reach the target and the second
is insufficient time to reach the form up point before the mission departs for
its target.

                             Fig 13


Escort squadrons are displayed by type (single and twin engined) and endurance.
Endurance is measured by how long the escorts can remain in company with the
bombers; i.e. a given escort squadron may be able to reach the form up point,
the first leg plot mark, the second leg plot mark or escort all the way to the
target.  An escort squadron unable to complete the full mission will turn back
for home once its endurance is exhausted.  In our example, all 15 SE fighter
squadrons and 6 TE fighter squadrons can escort the mission all the way to the
target.

There are two methods of allocating squadrons to missions.  They are displayed
in the menu window.  Use the arrow keys to select the chosen method.  Using
<AUTO> is much quicker and highly recommended for beginners.  To use automatic
mission selection, position the cursor on the <AUTO> line and type (RET).

The cursor is now flashing in the boxed information display at the bottom of
the mission data screen.  All that the player need do is decide how many bomber
and fighter squadrons he wishes to use in the mission.  In this example, we'll
send 10 bomber and 6 fighter squadrons.  Type (10)(RET) (6)(RET) (Y)(RET).

Important Note.  Once you have typed (Y)(RET) in the <Activate Mission> line,
the mission itself cannot be aborted.  All you do is abort individual squadrons
from it.  The method for aborting individual squadrons is explained below.
Once you have aborted every squadron from a mission, the mission can be
re-used.  However, at any point prior to activating the mission, you can
correct errors or change your mind by typing (ESC/f1) to recover the previous
step and re-enter your new decisions.

You can now review the squadrons committed to the mission.  The mission data
screen has been replaced by the strategic map. The arrow keys are used to
cycle through the squadrons assigned to the command.  Squadrons assigned to
the mission are identified by the word <briefing> appearing under the squadron
data.  The national cursor indicates the map location of the squadron under
review.  Consider fig 14.

Squadron 1/KG1, based at Montdidier, is under review.  Its plane type is
He 111H, it's a medium bomber, its crew is fit, they're veterans, they have no
special training skills and they are briefing for the mission just set. Details
of the mission appear in the lower part of the display.  The distance is 10
(200 miles), ETA is 1000 hrs, a full payload of 7,200 lbs is carried and a
total of 16 squadrons have been assigned to this mission.  To abort this
squadron from the mission, type (RET) then (Y)(RET) in response to the <ABORT>
question asked.  The default value is (N).

Type (ESC/f1) to complete the mission and recover Menu 11.
The Computer does not choose randomly when assigning squadrons to a mission
under an <AUTO> order.  bomber squadrons are selected according to the
following priority.

(a) One pathfinder squadron, if available.
(b) Heavy and/or medium bombers with a full payload.
(c) Heavy and/or medium bombers with any payload.
(d) Other bombers with a full payload
(e) Any bomber that can make it.

Priority for fighter squadrons is as follows.

(a) Fighters which can reach the target.
(b) Fighters which can reach the second leg plot mark.
(c) Fighters which can reach the first leg plot mark.
(d) Fighters which can reach the form up point.

Other points to note when forming a mission are listed below.

(a) Fighter-bomber squadrons can only be used in an escort role.
(b) Bomber squadrons will usually fly at their optimum altitude.  Occasionally
they will attempt to sneak in low, especially against port and communication
facilities.
(c) Fighter squadrons will escort at variable altitudes to provide the best
protection possible.
The second method for assigning squadrons will throw you directly into the
squadron selection routine.  As with the review just made, the arrow keys are
used to cycle through the available squadrons.  To select a particular
squadron, locate its I.D. code with the arrow keys and type (RET).

You are required to select an approach altitude.  The default value is the
optimum altitude for that plane type and, as a general guide, it's best to
leave it as such.  Selecting higher altitudes will reduce AA losses and may
allow you to sneak past interceptors at a lower altitude.  However, flight
characteristics deteriorate rapidly at  higher altitudes so you risk being
bounced in a very vulnerable condition.  Selecting lower altitudes will
increase the likelihood of interception and Observer Corps detection but may
allow you to avoid detection by certain radar sets.  Furthermore, the lower
the altitude of your bombers then the less room there is for evasive
maneuvering.  This will usually result in higher aircraft losses.

You are now given the opportunity to abort the squadron.  The procedure for
this is the same as the previous method.  That's it for missions.

Setting a Raid.  Much of the procedure for setting a raid is the same as for
setting a mission.  Select the <RAID> line from Menu 11 and you will obtain
a screen almost identical to fig 8.  The one difference is that tactical
targets (i.e. airfields, radar stations and shipping lanes) are selectable
provided, of course, the C-in-C has not ordered otherwise.

For this example, let's bomb an airfield.  Locate the <AIRF> line and type
(Y)(RET).  Every enemy airbase is displayed on the strategic map and the arrow
keys are used to cycle the national cursor through each one.  The text above
the menu window identifies the airbase while a weather prediction for its
location is presented in the menu window itself.  There is no recon value for
airfields (or radar stations and shipping lanes).  They are considered to be
reconned for strike purposes at all times.

Biggin Hill is an important sector airfield for Fighter Command so we'll choose
it as the target for our raid.  Use the arrow keys to locate it.  Fig 15
illustrates the resultant screen.

<ADV'CE ETA> display informs us that the raid would strike its target at 0100
hrs if we launched it now.  This would be pretty useless since 2/SG1 is not
trained for night operations and tactical targets such as airfields are very
difficult to hit at night anyway.  Note, however, that 2/SG1 is trained for
naval operations.  We would be well advised to advance the ETA to daylight;
0630 hrs seems just right.  We may be able to catch some British fighters on
the ground.  Type (6)(RET) (30)(RET) and you can see from fig 17 that 2/SG1
is briefing for an ETA of 0630 hrs carrying half of its maximum payload.  You
can type (RET) to obtain the abort routine or (ESC/f1) to complete the raid.

Note also that more than one squadron can be assigned to a particular target.
You don't have to go through the target selection procedure again.  Use the
arrow keys to select each squadron you wish to allocate, fix their approach
altitudes and determine their ETA's as above.

Setting a Harassment.  The first step in preparing a harassment strike is the
same as the procedure for setting a raid; i.e. a target type must be selected.
Locate the <HARASS> line in Menu 11 and type (RET).  The target types
available for selection will be the same as those available for raids with the
exception that harassments cannot be mounted against population.

Choose a target type (e.g. radar stations) and type (Y)(RET).  You will be
presented with the squadron selection routine and you can use the arrow keys
to select a squadron for the harassment.  An individual target is not
specified.  Throughout the day (or night if the squadron is night trained),
elements of the squadron (between 2-6 aircraft) will mount sporadic strikes
against that target type.  Harassments can be used for two purposes.  The first
is as a prelude to more substantial raids and missions to disrupt and confuse
fighter defenses.  The second is to inflict widespread (if minor) damage to
many targets at a time when the enemy fighters are engaged with more serious
threats.

In other words, the best results are obtained by a mix of offensive operations.
With a little bit of practice you'll soon get the proportions right.

Setting a Sweep.  Sweeps are fighter patrols mounted over enemy territory.
Select <SWEEP> from Menu 11 and type (RET).  Use the cursor to select the
particular type of enemy target you wish to patrol (either centre, airfield,
radar station or shipping lane) and type (RET).  The national cursor appears
on the strategic map and is used to select the chosen patrol location.  Once
this location has been identified by the national cursor, type (RET) to enter
the squadron selection routine.  Only fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons are
eligible for sweeps.  Use the arrow keys to locate the chosen squadron and type
(RET).  A patrol altitude and an ETA must be set for the squadron.  You may
type (RET) once the squadron is briefing if you wish to abort the sweep.

Fighter squadrons are unavailable for other assignments until their sweeps are
completed.  Once they have landed, rearmed and refueled, then they are
available for defensive duties; namely intercepts and patrols.

Use sweeps wherever possible as they are the best protection (other than cloudy
skies) for raids and harassments.  Be careful not to assign too many fighter
squadrons, however, lest you run out of interceptors to protect your own
targets.

Setting a Recon.  These are the least exciting, but probably most important
strikes of the game.  In the absence of current intelligence, strikes against
centres will produce dismal results.

Select the <RECON> line from Menu 11.  All enemy centres are displayed on the
strategic map and the arrow keys are used to cycle the national cursor through
them.  Only centres can be reconned.  Locate the chosen centre and type (RET)
to enter the squadron selection routine.  Only recon trained squadrons are
eligible.  Use the arrow keys to locate the chosen squadron and type (RET) to
assign it to the recon.  You may type (RET) once the squadron is briefing if
you wish to abort the recon.

Recon ops are similar to harassments.  Throughout the day, elements of the
squadron will continuously recon the chosen centre or any other centre within
three hexes of it.

We highly recommend that you prepare all your recon ops before making any
other plans for the day.  And remember, you really do have to recon a centre
the day before you plan an operation against it if you want to get the best
results.

Menu 14 (Squad Status Select)
-----------------------------
This branch menu if used select the format in which you wish to review your
squadron summary.  You may elect to review them by type of strike flown (Ops)
or availability (Status).

Menu 15 (Squadron Report)
-------------------------
Both these menus are information menus.
The <STATUS> of each squadron is displayed by both type and role.

The <OPS> for which each squadron has been assigned are displayed in three
categories; recon ops, mission ops, and other (harassments, sweeps and raids)
ops.

Menu 16 (Enemy Target Select)
-----------------------------
This branch menu allows a Commander to review a summary of all operations
planned by every commander on his side.  Note that computer controlled
commanders will issue their orders before human commanders.  This menu is
accessible during the midnight/mid-day interphase.

Menu 17 (Review Strike Targets)
-------------------------------
This is an information menu.  On selecting a strike type from Menu 16 you are
presented with a summary of all strikes of that type on the strategic map.

This information is primarily of use when human commanders are attempting to
co-ordinate attacks with computer commanders.  It should be consulted prior
to assigning ops.

Menu 18 (Run-Time Ops Select)
-----------------------------
This branch menu is accessible throughout the day.  It allows each Air Fleet
Commander to launch intercepts, set defensive patrols, view reports, examine
enemy strike plots on the tactical display and view the weather report.

Menu 19 (Assign Intercept)
--------------------------
This action menu is the means by which friendly fighter squadrons are vectored
onto enemy aircraft for the purpose of, hopefully, shooting them down.  The
proper use of this menu is best explained with the aid of an example.

We are controlling 11 Group of Fighter Command.  Three enemy air formations
have been detected by and are identified on the screen by miniature maltese
crosses.  Note that the game stops immediately on every new sighting, whether
radar detection combat key is switched off.

Select Menu 19.  The strategic map is displayed showing the position of enemy
air formations and friendly airfields.  The national cursor has identified one
of the enemy air groups and information pertaining to it appears in the right
hand column.  Enemy air formations will generally be identified as incoming
or outgoing.  As yet there are no interceptors assigned to this sighting.

Incoming Axis aircraft are identified by a + icon.

Outgoing Axis aircraft are identified by a small plane icon facing to the left
of the screen.

Incoming Allied aircraft are identified by a o icon.

Outgoing Allied aircraft are identified by a small plane icon facing to the
right of the screen.

All interceptors are identified by a small diamond icon.

Remember that incoming enemy represent a much greater threat than those
returning home.  Consider fig 18.

The enemy air formation is a group of approximately 20 aircraft at 20000 ft and
incoming.  Use the arrow keys to cycle through the remaining enemy air
formations.

It's hard to guess where they're headed since they are still on their side of
the Channel.  Rather than exhaust the endurance of our short range fighters,
we'll observe them until they come a little closer.

It's best to use the <RUN 5> line (i.e. advance the time by single 5 minute
increments) when action is imminent.  Within 5 minutes the bogies have crossed
the Channel and it's time to Reach for the Sky!  We select Menu 19 again and
locate the same group of enemy aircraft.  Type (RET) to select that formation
as the target for our interception.

The targeted enemy formation is identified by the target icon while the
cursor has moved to the upper right hand column to permit automatic fighter
interception.  In this example, 12 fighter and/or fighter bomber squadrons
are in close (optimum - less than 60 miles) intercept range while a further
8 squadrons are at maximum intercept range; i.e. within 150 miles.

Note that squadrons on patrol are available for intercept assignment.

Continuing with the example, we'll assign one squadron to intercept.  Note
that the computer will select a close range squadron before one at maximum
range.  Enter (1) and type (RET) to obtain the squadron data display in the
right hand column.  Use the arrow keys to cycle through the available
squadrons until we locate the assigned squadron as illustrated in fig 19.

     (Note: The word including in 'ÛÛÛÛÛÛÛ' means highlight the option)

The 14 Spitfires of 32 squadron are briefing to intercept.  The distance to
intercept is 3 hexes (60 miles) and as it will take 10 minutes for the
Spitfires to reach the 20,000 ft altitude of the bogies, this squadron is
ideally suited to be used.  (Consult the Design Manual if you wish to know
more about aircraft characteristics.)  Note that the player does not assign
an altitude to an interceptor.

Type (ESC/f1) to confirm the intercept.  Type (RET) to access the abort
routine.

If you do not wish to use the automatic intercept routine, leave the assigned
squadron number at (0) and type (RET).  The squadron data display appears and
the arrow keys are used to locate the desired intercept squadrons.  Type (RET)
to brief, use the arrow keys to select further interceptors if so desired,
then type (ESC/f1) to confirm.  The abort routine is accessed by typing (RET)
once a squadron is briefing.

Defending against a large enemy attack is a nerve-wracking experience.  We
recommended that you use the automatic intercept routine for your first few
games.

Menu 20 (Set Patrol)
--------------------
This action menu is the means by which friendly fighter squadrons are put on
defensive patrol over friendly territory.  Patrols are set using exactly the
same procedure as used for setting a sweep.  The differences are that they
are placed over friendly centres and facilities and a decision must be made
between a standing patrol and a full squadron patrol.  Standing patrols are
maintained by elements of the squadron from the specified ETA until nightfall
or daylight, whichever is applicable.  Full squadron patrols protect the area
from the specified ETA until their endurance runs out.

Standing patrols are a general precaution while full squadron patrols should
be used when serious enemy action is all but certain.

Note also that patrols may be set at any time throughout the day while sweeps
are set only at midnight and mid-day.  As a general rule, offensive operations
require much greater preparation and briefing time.

A defensive patrol may be converted to an intercept at any time.  When using
the intercept menu (Menu 19), squadrons available for use include any on
defensive patrol and within range.  Be careful not to confuse patrolling
squadrons with those awaiting orders on the ground.

Menu 21 (Squadron Report Select)
--------------------------------
This branch menu is accessible throughout the day.  It divides squadrons into
convenient categories for detailed examination.  These categories are -

(a) Available.  All fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons awaiting an
intercept or patrol assignment.
(b) Active.  All fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons currently in the air on
intercept or patrol assignments.
(c) Outgoing.  All strike squadrons (i.e. those with mission, raid, harassment,
sweep or recon assignments) currently in the air and which have not as yet
reached their targets.
(d) Returning.  All squadrons which have completed their assignment or run out
of endurance, whether offensive or defensive, and have not as yet landed and
become available for a further assignment.
(e) Stood Down.  All squadrons which have been given rest and recuperation
orders for this 12 hour period.  These squadrons are not available for any
combat purpose.

Menu 22 (Examine Squadron)
--------------------------
This information menu provides detailed information on each squadron, including
such combat information as number of aircraft lost and/or damaged and the
particulars of their current assignment.

Select the category (from Menu 21) you wish to examine and type (RET).  The
arrow keys are used to cycle through all the squadrons in that category.

Menu 23 (View Enemy Flight Paths)
---------------------------------
This information menu is used to assess the likely intentions and flight paths
of enemy air formations.

On selecting this menu, the national cursor appears in the centre of the
strategic map.  Use the I,J,K,M keys to move the cursor to the part of the map
you are interested in and type (RET) to obtain the tactical map.  Fig 20 shows
the flight path of an enemy air formation.

Every 15 minutes the flight paths are cleared to minimize the likelihood of
multiple flight paths producing confusion.  Be aware, however, that during
periods of feverish activity in a single area, there will be inevitable
confusion created.  You will understand pretty quickly why so many ground
controllers got ulcers.


5. THE COMPUTER'S ROLE
======================

5.1 General Administration.
---------------------------
In addition to resolving combat, the computer performs a large number of
administrative functions at regular intervals throughout the day.

Fatigue and Recovery.  Every assignment given to a squadron will increase the
fatigue level of its pilots/crews.  The size of this increase is related to
the type of plane, type of assignment, amount of combat and pilot/crew skill.
Available and stood down squadrons are eligible for fatigue recovery.  Stood
down squadrons (i.e. those given leave) recover at a much faster rate.

Promotion.  There are thee levels of pilot/crew skill in the game - veteran,
experienced and trained.  As a result of combat, there will be a steady loss
of the more skilled pilots, especially over enemy territory where pilot/crew
recoveries almost non-existent.  To replace these men, a variable proportion
of trained pilots/crew will be upgraded in skill.  During periods of fierce
combat, the overall level of pilot/crew competence will usually fall, most
markedly when the bulk of the action is over enemy territory.

Reinforcements.  There are no reinforcements as such in the game.  Squadrons
which are to become operational during the course of a scenario begin the game
without aircraft and/or with maximum fatigue.  They use the general
replacement and recovery procedures to bring themselves up to strength.

Fog and General Mishaps.  The prevalence or otherwise of fog is dependent upon
the season, current weather, time of day and proximity to the coast.  Aircraft
attempting to take off from a fog-bound airfield may be delayed from doing so
until the fog clears.  Too long a delay may result in the assignment being
cancelled.  Aircraft attempting to land on a fog-bound airfield will be
diverted to nearby fog-free airfields.  This will result in a loner period
elapsing before the squadron is again available for assignment.

Throughout the course of WWII, the number of aircraft and crew lost in
accidents was at least equal to the number lost in combat and to reflect this
the computer is continually analyzing the status of each squadron to determine
if any calamity has befallen.  Causes of accidents include take-offs, landings,
running out fuel, magneto drop, sneaking off to Switzerland or Sweden and just
plain bad luck.  The likelihood of such misfortunes is dependent upon a myriad
of factors, including crew experience and special training, weather, fatigue,
time of day and, again, luck.

Not every accident results in the loss of plane and crew; in fact most result
in a damaged aircraft and an intact crew.  The number of damaged aircraft on
a squadron's roster is calculated by subtracting the number of operational
aircraft from the total aircraft number.

Aircraft Repair.  Damaged aircraft are continually being repaired throughout
the day by the squadron's ground personnel.  Each midnight and mid-day
interphase, repaired aircraft are added to, and cannibalized aircraft removed
from, a squadron's operational roster.

Repairs are at their speediest when a squadron is stood down.  All of the
ground personnel are used to get the crocks back on deck.

5.2 Victory Determination
-------------------------
There are two ways to win in Europe Ablaze.  The C-in-C's victory points are
the sum (positive or negative) of his Commanders' achievements.  The side with
the highest C-in-C total is the side that wins the scenario.

However, the Commander (on either side) with the highest individual number of
points is the player who wins the game.

A player must have a positive point total to get any kind of victory.

Note that a game ended earlier than the established scenario end point by the
use of Menu 3 (End Game Utility) will access the same victory routine as a game
ended by the expiry of time.

Victory points are awarded to Air Fleet Commanders for the destruction of enemy
aircraft and the successful bombing of enemy targets.  Bonus victory points are
achieved by exceptionally effective bombing missions.

A C-in-C's victory point total is the sum of his Air Fleet Commanders' totals,
with any negative scores counting double.  Furthermore the C-in-C receives the
victory points awarded for the destruction of enemy aircraft by flak units.

5.3 Miscellaneous Matters
-------------------------
Transfers.  Operational transfers, in general, fall outside the scope of the
game; the scenarios are too short to bother with them.  Tactical transfers,
however, such as shuttle strikes (i.e. England to Italy and back again) and
fighter staging (as practiced by the Luftwaffe in 1944-1945) proved too costly
in memory for the benefit they could add to the game.

Squadron Size.  In the third scenario there are some 6,500 aircraft.  To
organize them into the 255 squadrons allowed has meant some squashing.  For
example, a US heavy bomb group contains 4 squadrons, each of 16 aircraft.  We
have combined them into 2 half bomb groups of 31 aircraft each.

The Orders of Battle.  Complete OB information is always hard to find and much
of what is available is conflicting.  German sources, especially for the later
scenarios, is sketchy.  We area fairly confident that our unit ID's and plane
types are correct.  Exact numbers and to a lesser extent, precise locations
are less certain.  If you can find more accurate information, use it - and let
us know.

Mistakes.  We've just found this one.  It's not serious, but could be a bit
confusing to novice scenario designers.  When you are creating a new map, use
the <CLEAR DATA> routine before the facilities from the old scenario will
appear on the new map until you replace them with new facilities.


6. THE SCENARIOS
================

There are three historical scenarios included with the game system.  The inside
surfaces of the game album give a brief resume of the situation they cover.
We have not included a detailed listing of available air assets in this manual
since (as you will have discovered) complete OB information is available to the
players via menus 5,6,8,14 and 21 as well as a thorough examination through the
Design Manual.

The threshold values for each command have been calculated to give each Air
Fleet Commander an equal chance for victory.  The best chance to win big is,
of course, with a major command - conversely, you won't come last playing
Coastal Command.

7. DESIGNER'S NOTES
===================

Well, we are only three months late with Europe Ablaze.  Which is a whole lot
better than the seven month delay with Carriers at War.  At this rate we might
even get Road to Appomattox out on time - but I doubt it!

We have trouble leaving good enough alone.  What started out as an operational
simulation of the strategic air war in Europe has ended up, in addition, as a
game with a huge number of subtle tactical options.  The wide variety of
assignments, target diversity and the relationships between them will provide
enough work for even the most dedicated gamer.

In fact, it was this combination of strategic and tactical decision making that
led us to experiment with the two level command structure.

By taking the C-in-C's role, you can direct an air offensive without issuing
orders to a single plane.  Conversely you can direct, in intimate detail, the
operations of a component of that air offensive by taking a Commander's role.

Or you can do both and try to run everything.  If you're a glutton for
punishment, then this is a job for you.

One very important piece of advice.  Trust the computer to be a worthwhile ally
in either a defensive or offensive role, you can be pretty sure it won't let
you down - we just hope you don't let the computer down!

START MENUS
===========

KEY SUMMARY
-----------
TO cycle within a menu, type (RET).
To select from a menu, type (Y)(RET).
To recover the previous menu, type (ESC).
Note that the START MENUS cannot be recovered from the GAME MENU (H) or the
DESIGN MENU (J).


STARTING THE GAME
-----------------
Place the Europe Ablaze disk into your disk drive.  Be sure the Master side is
facing up.  Close your disk and turn on your computer.  Menu A (the Start Up
Menu) will appear on your screen.

SYSTEM SET UP
-------------
The Master disk is configured for Apple IIc's and IIe's with one disk drive and
no printer.  If this description fits your system, please skip this section.
To change the set up, type (RET) until the cursor is on the <KEYS> line and
then type (Y)(RET) to obtain Menu D (the Keyboard Menu).  Now type (RET) until
the cursor is on the <EDIT> line in Menu D then type (Y)(RET) to enter the
keyboard display.  Change whichever of the following are necessary.

(a) The Arrow Keys.  Early Apple II owners will have to select keys to
substitute for the (UP) and (DOWN), arrow keys.  We suggest the (') and (/)
keys.  This substitution is made by typing (')(RET) (RET)(/).

(b) The Data Drives.  If you have two drives, position the cursor on the
<Data Drive> line and type (2).  This will instruct the computer to look at the
second disk drive for scenario, save game and backup disks.

(c) The Print slot and Dump Code.  Cntl(P) will activate a high resolution
screen dump routine reproducing the current screen image onto an attached
printer.  Enter the slot # of your printer.  The words <Enter dump code now>
will appear and you should enter the appropriate dump code for your printer.
For example, our C-ITOH 8510 Prowriter with a Digitek card uses the code Cntl
(I)(G).  Type (RET) when you have finished entering the code.  Note that Cntl
characters appear in inverse.  Turn on your printer and type Cntl(P).  The
keyboard display should be dumped to the printer.  An incorrect entry may
cause the program to hang so please check that you know the correct dump code
for your printer.  (See your printer manual or ask at a computer store).

SAVING YOUR SYSTEM SET UP
-------------------------
Type (ESC) to go back to Menu D.  Type (RET) until the cursor is on the <SAVE>
line and then type (Y)(RET).  The set up information is saved to your Master
disk.

BLACK AND WHITE MONITORS
------------------------
If your system uses a monochrome monitor we recommend you type Cntl(B) as soon
as Menu A appears.

BACKING-UP YOUR DISKS
---------------------
The Master disk may be backed up once.  Type (ESC) to go back to Menu A, type
(RET) until the cursor is on the <BACKUP> line and then type (Y)(RET) to obtain
Menu B (the Backup Menu).  Position the cursor on the <MASTER> line and type
(Y)(RET).  Follow the instructions given on the screen until the duplication is
complete and Menu A is recovered.  The Scenario disk, on the reverse side of
the Master disk, may be backed up any number of times.  At least one backup of
the Scenario disk is essential if you wish to make use of the two disk drive
option.

As an additional precaution we suggest you write protect your disks once your
backups have been made.

SAVING OR RESTARTING A GAME
---------------------------
There is no need to go through this procedure until you have a need for it.

(a) Saving a Game.  Select Menu H, position the cursor on the <DISK> line and
type (Y)(RET) to obtain Menu 4 from the Game Menus.  Place a blank disk in the
correct disk drive.  Select the <INIT> line and type (Y)(RET) to initialize
the disk if you have not previously done so.  Select the <EDIT> line and type
(Y)(RET).  Your save game disk is formatted to hold 5 saved games.  Type (RET)
until the cursor is positioned on the <SAVE> line of any unused save location
and then type (Y)(RET).  You may enter a comment of up to 17 characters, then
type (RET).  Note that the scenario from which the game is saved will appear
below the <Comment> line.  Type (ESC) to continue playing the game.

(b) Restarting a Saved Game.  Select Menu C from Menu A.  Select <EDIT> then
position the cursor on the <LOAD> line of the chosen saved game.  Type (Y)(RET)
then (ESC) to restart the game.

Once these instructions have been completed, please proceed to the introductory
tutorials in the Player's Manual.
