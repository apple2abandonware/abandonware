GAUGE DESCRIPTIONS:

     NOW YOU MUST LOAD THE GAME AND LOOK AT THE GAUGE SCREEN.

     IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER THERE IS A DIAL WITH ONE 0 ON IT. THIS IS
        THE BATTERY CHARGE LEVEL. BATTERIES ARE NECESSARY FOR SUBMERGING AND
        CRUISING ON SURFACE. THEY ARE GOOD FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR OF HIGH SPEED
        MOVEMENT, UP TO 6 HOURS AT L OW SPEEDS.ON THE SURFACE, THEY GRADUALLY
        RECHARGE THEMSELVES.

     DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS GAUGE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS. THE LEFT WILL LIGHT UP
        WHEN THE BATTERY IS BEING CHARGED. THE RIGHT WILL LIGHT UP WHEN THE
        BATTERY IS BEING DRAINED.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE BATTERY GAUGE IS ANOTHER DIAL WITH NUMBERS FROM 0 TO
        15 ON IT. THIS IS THE SPEED IN KNOTS THE SUB IS TRAVELLING. 20 KNOTS
        IS MAXIMUM SPEED ON SURFACE, WHILE 10 IS MAXIMUM UNDERWATER.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THIS IS A DIAL WITH NUMBERS FROM 0 TO 300 ON IT. THIS IS
        YOUR DEPTH IN FEET FROM THE SURFACE. THE 'P' INDICATES YOUR PERISCOPE
        LEVEL (44 FEET). THE SCOPE WILL NOT OPERATE BENEATH THE 'P'.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE DEPTH GAUGE IS A BOX SHOWING TORPEDOS. IN THE UPPER
        LEFT HAND CORNER OF THIS BOX IS THE PERISCOPE INDICATOR. BLACK MEANS
        IT'S DOWN, GREEN MEANS UP. THE TORPEDOS IN THE BOX INDICATE WHICH OF
        THE 10 TORPEDO TUBES ARE READY TO FIRE. GREEN MEANS READY, BLACK MEANS
        RE-LOADING. IT TAKES ABOUT 10 GAME MINUTES TO RE-LOAD A TUBE.THE
        NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS BOX INDICATE HOW MANY TORPEDOS ARE LEFT
        IN ADDITION TO THE ONES ALREADY LOADED.

     BENEATH THE BATTERY GAUGE (ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN) THERE IS A BOX
        WITH THREE VERTICAL ROWS OF LIGHTS. THIS IS THE FUEL GAUGE. AS YOU USE
        FUEL THE TANKS FILL UP WITH WATER. THE FUEL FLOATS ON TOP. THE LIGHTS
        INDICATE YOUR FUEL A ND WATER LEVEL IN EACH OF THE THREE TANKS. BLACK=
        FUEL LEVEL, WHITE= WATER LEVEL. FULL FUEL TANKS CAN LAST 50-60 DAYS.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THE FUEL LEVEL THERE ARE 2 DIALS, ONE ON TOP OF THE
        OTHER. THE TOP ONE IS THE NUMBER OF FEET BETWEEN YOUR CURRENT DEPTH
        AND THE SEA BOTTOM. WHEN IT REACHES 0, YOU HAVE RUN AGROUND. DIRECTLY
        BENEATH THIS GAUGE IS THE WAT ER TEMPERATURE GAUGE. AS FAR AS I CAN
        TELL, IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS.

     TO THE RIGHT OF THESE GAUGES IS THE 'CHRISTMAS TREE'. THESE LIGHTS
        INDICATE THE STATUS OF ALL HULL OPENINGS. GREEN= CLOSED, RED= OPEN.
        ALL HULL OPENINGS CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN SUBMERGERGED.

     DIRECTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE IS THE COMPASS. UNDERNEATH
        THAT IS THE THROTTLE INDICATOR, AND TO THE RIGHT OF THESE IS THE
        CLOCK. THE SWEEP HAND INDICATES THE MINUTES, AND THE HOUR IS PRINTED
        AT THE BOTTOM.

     BENEATH THE CLOCK IS THE DIVE BUBBLE. THE BUBBLE IN THE BAR WILL SLIDE TO
        THE RIGHT OR LEFT TO INDICATE DIVING OR SURFACING, OR STAY IN THE
        MIDDLE TO INDICATE NO VERTICAL TRAVEL.
