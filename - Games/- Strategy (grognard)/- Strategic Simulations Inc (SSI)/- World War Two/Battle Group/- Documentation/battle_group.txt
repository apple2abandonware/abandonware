1.0 INTRODUCTION
BATTLEGROUP is a platoon-level tactical game of combat on the Western 
Front from 1943 to 1945.
1.1 Description of Action:
Each game turn consists of two phases. In the orders phase, the 
players, one at a time, give orders to the units which they control. In the 
joint combat phase all units carry out these orders, one unit at a time. The 
combat phase represents two minutes of action, broken down into four 
30-second pulses. 
1.2 Talking to the Computer:
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers, type the 
number into the computer and press the <RETURN> key. To select a routine from 
a menu or answer a Yes/No question, just press the desired key. WHERE THE 
EXIT COMMAND IS NOT SPECIFIED, PRESS <X> TO EXIT THE MENU.
1.3 Saving a Game: 
At the end of the DEPLOYMENT PHASE and at the end of each COMBAT PHASE, 
the computer will allow the player(s) to save the game in progress. You will 
need a scratch disk to store the save game data. Save game disks may be 
initialized for SSI use during a game by following Instructions included in 
the game program. Each save disk with hold approximately 4-6 games. Warning: 
the program will not prompt you when you have exceeded the disk space on your 
save game disk.  Once a game is saved you with be able to restart it at the 
point you left off.
WHEN RESTARTING A SAVED GAME YOU MUST SET THE CORRECT NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON 
THE OPENING MENU.
1.4  The Map:
The BATTLEGROUP map is a 60 X 60 square grid with each square measuring 
200 yards across. At the start of each game the terrain is randomized in 
accordance with parameters determined by the player.
1.5 Starting the Game (Apple):
To begin the game, boot side one and the game will begin automatically. 
If you are using an Apple II with Pascal you must first use your BASICS disk. 
If you are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple II emulation mode. 
if you elect to play a historical scenario, the computer will ask You to 
insert side two of the disk so that it may read in the scenario data. when 
this is complete the computer will instruct you to reinsert side one for the 
remainder of the game.
1.6 Starting the Game (Atari):
To begin the game, boot the Scenario side of Your disk. Before 
beginning remove all cartridges from your computer. Owners of the 8OOXL will 
have to hold down the OPTION key when they turn on their computer to boot the 
game. After you have deployed your forces (or after you have selected to play 
a historicaL scenario) , the computer will ask you to insert the Game side of 
your disk.
1.7 Starting the Game (Commodore):
To begin the game, insert the game disk into Your disk drive. Type LOAD 
' *", 8 and press <RETURN> . When READY appears, type RUN and press <RETURN> 
. 
1.8 Sound:
During the combat phase, players may toggle the sound ON/OFF by 
pressing the 'S' key.

3.0  STARTING THE GAME
3.1 Determining Conditions of Play:
   At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under 
which the game will be played. On the Apple version the conditions may be 
changed by entering  the following numbers:
(1)  NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2)  1 DISK DRIVE or 2 DISK DRIVES
(3)  SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(4)  HANDICAP LEVEL
(5)  DELAY LENGTH
(6)  SELECT SCENARIO
On the ATARI and C-64'" versions:
(1)  NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2)  SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(3)  HANDICAP LEVEL
(4)  DELAY LENGTH
(5)  SELECT SCENARiO
3.2  Player Determination:
BATTLEGROUP may be played by either zero, one, or two players, and this 
is determined by the option selected on the menu. For example, if you wished 
to watch a computer controlled German force face a computer controlled 
Russian force, you should select the option BOTH COMPUTER.
3.3   Handicap Level:
At the start of the game the players must determine the handicap level 
(1-5) . The effects of handicap levels are listed below:
Level 1:  German strength reduced 50%
Level 2:  German strength reduced 25%
LeveL 3:  No reduction
Level 4:  Allied strength reduced 25%
Level 5:  Allied strength reduced 50%
EXAMPLE: At level 1 the number of weapons in German platoons would be reduced 
by approximately 50%.
3.4 Delay Length:
The delay length affects messages displayed during the Combat Phase. 
The greater the delay length, the longer these messages will remain displayed 
during the Combat Phase. A delay length of 1 will speed up the game, but will 
cause the messages to be virtually unreadable. A delay length of 9 will slow  
the game considerably, but will allow the player maximum time to study the 
various reports provided during the Combat Phase. Any integer between 1 to 9 
may be entered.
3.5 Selecting a Scenario:
You may select one of 4 historical scenarios (see section 9.0), or you 
may elect to build your own scenario. If you select a historical scenario, 
the computer will skip the deployment phase and go directly to turn 1. If you 
elect to build your own scenario you will be asked several questions (see 
sections 3.6-3.9). New players are advised to begin by playing scenarios they 
have created. Creating and playing a small meeting engagement is recommended. 
Do not attempt to play historical scenarios until you are completely  
familiar with the game.
3.6 Building the Map:
At the start of the game the computer will generate a new map. Prior to 
generating the map the computer will allow the player(s) to input parameters 
that influence the nature of the terrain:
(1)  INCLUDE RIVER Y/N
(2)  COVER TERRAIN DENSiTY (O-9)
If option (1) is answered "Y" then the map will include a river. Option 
(2) allows the players to control quantity of woods and broken terrain 
included on the map. A "0" would allow no woods/broken terrain on the map; a 
"9" would mean heavy woods/ broken terrain density. Any number between 0 and 
9 may be entered.
3.7 Selecting the Time Period:
The player(s) may select from eight different time periods. The time 
period will affect the type of forces/equipment that may be used in the 
battle as well as the command control capabilities of the two armies.
3.8  Selecting the Type of Battle: The player(s) may select from five 
different types of battle:
(1) GERMAN PURSUIT
A small Allied force fights a rear-guard action against a large German 
force,
(2)  GERMAN ASSAULT
A large German force attacks a medium Allied force. Both sides may use 
off-map artillery.
(3) MEETING ENGAGEMENT
Opposing forces of equal strength advance on the same objective.
(4) ALLIED ASSAULT
A large Allied force attacks a medium German force. Both sides may use 
off-map artillery.
(5) ALLIED PURSUIT
A small German force fights a rear-guard action against a large Allied 
force.
The player(s) must also determine the size of the battle:
(1) LARGE
(2) SMALL
In a "small" battle the quantity of units on both sides will be reduced 
by approximately 50%.
3.9  Game Length
When building your own scenario, you will be asked to enter the number 
of turns you wish to have the game last. You may enter any number between 5 
and 255 (30 is the suggested number). The game will automatically end after 
the completion of the number of turns entered.
3.10  Selecting Forces:
The Allied player may select either a British Armor, British Infantry, 
U.S. Armor, or U.S. Infantry type force. The German player may select a 
Panzer, Motorized or Infantry type force. If the AUTO-SELECT routine is used 
then the computer will select a force to suit the type of battle.
The players have a limited number of selection points (SPs) that they 
may use to "buy" various types of companies or battalions. The computer will 
only allow the selection of formations that are appropriate for the type of 
force selected.
The player(s) will receive 20 victory points for each SP that is not 
used to buy combat formations. A maximum of 250 points may be received in 
this manner.
4.0 DEPLOYMENT:
When creating a new scenario, the player(s) may arrange their units on 
the map before the game begins to optimize their attack or defense. Allied 
units may not be deployed west (left) of their "start line" and German units 
may not be deployed east (right) of their "start line ". If the AUTO-DEPLOY 
routine is used then the computer will automatically deploy the units on the 
map. AUTO-DEPLOY will not provide the best possible deployment; it represents 
a "hasty" deployment. If the AUTO-DEPLOY routine is not used, the players 
will find their units at the top of the map.
4.1 Combat Formations:
All units in the game are organized into combat formations (CFs). CFs 
consist of a headquarters (HQ) unit with from 1 to 8 attached combat units. 
CFs are each assigned an identification letter (A-U) . The units attached to 
a CF are each assigned an index number (0-9) . The formation letter and the 
index number are combined to form the unit ID. EXAMPLE: the 3rd unit in 
formation C would have C3 as its UNIT ID.
The HQ unit in all CFs will be assigned index number "0".
4.2 The Map Display:
The map display used in BATTLEGROUP is a 60 X 60 square grid. Only a 
fraction of the map (20 squares wide by 10 squares high) may be viewed at one 
time. By pressing the keys 1-8 the cursor can be moved around the map (1-N, 
2-NE, 3-E, 4-SE, 5-S, 6-SW, 7-W, 8-NW). If the cursor is moved to the edge of 
the display then the map will scroll to reveal the hidden portions of the 
map. When playing an assault type battle, the map is reduced to 60 X 30 (60 
spaces east-west by 30 spaces north-south).
4.3 Unit Symbols:
All units on the map are identified by symbols that describe their 
function and nationality.
ALLIED VEHICLES are represented by vehicle silhouettes facing east.
ALLIED INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men underlined.
ALLIED ARTILLERY is represented by an underlined weapon symbol.
ALLIED STACK is represented by two overlapping white squares.
GERMAN VEHICLES are represented by vehicle silhouettes facing west.
GERMAN INFANTRY is represented by symbols of two men (no underline).
GERMAN ARTILLERY is represented by a weapon symbol (no underline).
GERMAN STACK is represented by two hollow overlapping squares.
CONFLICT (opposing forces on same square) is represented by an AL/GE symbol.
4.4   Map Display Menu:
The map display menu lists the following routines:
(1-8)  Move cursor.
  (9)  Build entrenchment (only before ASSAULT type battles).
  (0)  Use auto-deploy routine.
(A-T)  Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index
  number - computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU.
  (U)  Change terrain in square (see appendix 3 for terrain key).
  (V)  View. Inverses all squares with a line of sight to the
  cursor location.
  (W)  Move cursor to OBJECTIVE AREA (see 4.6) then START LiNE.
  (X)  Exit deployment phase.
  (Y)  Clear units from screen to view terrain.
       (Z)  Examine friendly units at cursor location.
4.5   Unit Orders Menu:
The unit described at the top of the text Window is the "current unit." 
The following routines may be used to adjust the starting location or inspect 
the status of the current unit:
(1-8)  Move cursor.
  (9)  Change weapon type of armored vehicle.
  (D)  Disembark unit. If unit is a vehicle then it will unload all
  of its passengers; if the unit is a passenger then only that
  unit will unload.
  (E)  Embark unit. Order must be given to a vehicle unit- the
  computer will request the ID of the unit to be embarked.
  (L)  Look for unit. The cursor will move to the unit's location.
  (M)  Move unit. The unit will move to the cursor location.
  (N)  Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the
  current unit.
  (P)  List  passengers.  Will list the units embarked aboard the
  current unit.
  (Q)  Quit the orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
  (V)  View. Inverses all squares that may be seen from the cursor
  location.
  (X)  Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display.
4.6  The Objective Area:
The objective area may be located by pressing the (W) key on the map 
display menu. The cursor will move to the CENTER of the objective area. The 
objective area is a 19 X 19 square area. In some scenarios the players will 
score points for each infantry man, gun or vehicle that ends the game in the 
objective area.
4.7  Saving the Set-Up:
At the conclusion of the deployment phase the computer will allow you 
to save the set-up on a disk initialized for SSI use (disks may be 
initialized at this time).
4.8 Entrenchments:
If the type of battle is an ALLIED ASSAULT or GERMAN ASSAULT then the 
players may "build" entrenchments for their units. Entrenchments are built by 
moving the cursor over a clear or road terrain square and pressing the "9" 
key when the computer is in MAP DISPLAY MODE.
 Players may build a maximum of 80 entrenchments. Entrenchments may only 
be built on the friendly side of the start line.
4.9  Off-Map Artillery:
Off-map artillery may be available only during assault type battles. 
Off-map artillery will be designated only as LIGHT, MEDIUM or HEAVY 
ARTILLERY. When selecting forces the player will receive off-map artillery by 
taking the German ARTILLERY DETACHMENT or the British ARTILLERY DETACHMENT, 
British HEAVY ARTILLERY BRIGADE, or U.S. ARTILLERY DETACHMENT.
Off-map artillery will never be displayed on the map. Available off-map 
artillery may be inspected after the game has started by using the 
BOMBARDMENT routine.
If AUTO-SELECT is used when playing an assault type battle, both sides 
will receive off-map artillery.
4.10 Changing the Map:
During the deployment phase, players may use the U key to create any 
terrain desired on any square of the map. This allows players to create any 
map desired. Move the cursor to the square you wish to change, type U, and 
then type the number of the terrain (see appendix 3 for a list of terrain 
types).
4.11  Changing Unit Composition:
Players wishing to create their own scenarios may change the weapons of 
any of the armored vehicles except halftracks. To change a unit's weapons go 
to the unit orders menu, type "9", type the identifying number of the weapon 
desired for the current unit (see section 6.0 for weapon numbers), and them 
type the number of weapons desired (must be less than 256). If the weapon 
type of a unit with a SIW is changed, then the unit will lose its SIW.
4.12  Visibility Level:
At the beginning of the first turn of each game, the computer will 
randomly determine the visibility level. The visibility level will be set 
between 7 and 20 and will remain constant throughout the game. The visibility 
level is the maximum range at which units may spot and direct fire at enemy 
units.
5.0  ORDERS PHASE
During the orders phase the player(s) may review the status of their 
units and assign movement, bombardment and targeting orders.
5.1  Map Display Menu:
The map display menu used during the orders phase is similar to the one 
used during the deployment phase.
   (1-8)  Move cursor.
(0)  End game.
   (A-U)  Select unit. Press formation letter followed by unit index number - 
computer will shift to UNIT ORDERS MENU; the selected unit will be the 
"current unit".
(V)  View. The computer will inverse all squares that can be seen from 
the cursor location.
(W)  Move cursor to center of objective area.
(X)  Exit orders phase.
(Y)  Clear units from screen to view terrain.
(Z)  Examine friendly or visible enemy units at cursor location.
5.2   Unit Orders Menu:
Upon selecting a unit from the map menu it will be displayed beneath 
the map showing its composition (number and type of vehicles or weapons), 
ammunition (shown as A, in pulses of firing remaining), facing (shown as a 
compass direction), speed (In movement point rate, it is also miles per   
hour), and whether it's loaded (an L is  displayed when loaded), and whether 
it has greater than 50 suppression (an * is displayed when the unit has
greater than 50 suppression). The following routines may be used to assign 
orders to or inspect the status of the current unit:
   (1-8) Move cursor.
(A)* Advance. This command is only used when the computer is in 
all-units mode; the formation HQ will move to the cursor location, other 
units in the formation will move in such a way as to retain their current 
position relative to the HQ.
(B)   Bombard. The cursor location is the target square; the current 
unit is the spotter; the computer will list the artillery units eligible to 
bombard the target (see section 5.6) .
(C)  Center. The map is centered around the cursor.
(D)  Disembark. If the current unit is a vehicle then it will unload 
all of its passengers; if the current unit is a passenger then only that unit 
will unload; unloaded passengers will have a suppression level of 80.
(E)  Embark. Order must be given to a vehicle unit - the computer will 
request the ID of the unit to be embarked (see section 5.4).
(F)* Change unit facing.
(H)  Find unit's HQ. Cursor moves to unit's HQ location; computer 
determines if a "command control" link exists between the current unit and 
the HQ; the HQ becomes the new current unit.
(I)  Inspect. Allows the player to inspect all enemy units that can be 
seen by the current unit; allows the current unit to designate a priority 
target and/or request a bombardment (with the current unit as the spotter). 
Assigning a priority target with the (I)nspect order will cause a range order 
to be given if the target is outside of the set maximum range, with the 
maximum firing range being set equal to the distance to the new target (see 
section 5.8).
(K)* Cancel all orders. Allows the current unit to cancel all movement 
and bombardment orders.
(L)  Look for unit. Moves the cursor to the current unit's location.
(M)* Move unit. Orders the unit to move to the cursor location (see 
section 5.5)
(N)  Next unit. The next higher numbered unit will become the current 
unit.
(O)  Check movement objectives. Moves the cursor to the movement 
objective location(s) of the current unit; also lists the command control 
delay (see section 5.5).
(P) List passengers. Lists all units embarked aboard the current unit. 
(Q) Quit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(R) Set maximum firing range at which the current unit will select 
targets (see section 5.7).
(S) Set movement speed for the current unit.
(T)  Inspect the target that the current unit has selected.
(V)  View. The computer will inverse all squares that the current unit 
can see with its current facing.
(X)  Exit the unit orders menu. Return to the map display menu.
(Z)  Shift to all-units mode.
5.3   All-Units Mode: Certain orders may be given to all of the units of a 
particular formation. These orders are followed by an "*" In the listing in 
5.2. The computer may be placed in "all-units mode" by pressing the letter 
"A" instead of the unit index number when selecting a unit from the map 
display menu. From the unit orders menu the player may shift to "all-units 
mode " by pressing the (Z) key. EXAMPLE: If the current unit is C4 and the 
(Z) key is pressed, then the computer will shift to all-units mode for 
formation C. C-ALL will be shown at the top of the text window and C0 will 
become the new current unit.
When the computer is in all-units mode then the current unit will 
always be the formation HQ. The computer may not be placed in all-units mode 
if the formation HQ has been destroyed.
5.4   Embarking Units:
All vehicle units may embark infantry type units. Only halftrack and 
truck units may embark artillery type units. Each vehicle may carry a maximum 
of 10 transport points. Listed below are the transport costs for each type of 
passenger:
SMG, RIFLE1
HMG2
81MOR, 82MOR3
12OMOR5
IG, HOW, FLACK, AT GUN  10
EXAMPLE: A platoon with 30 RIFLEs would require 3 vehicles to transport.
EXAMPLE: A battery of six 76AT guns would require 6 trucks or 
halftracks to transport.
After giving the (E)MBARK command the player must enter the ID of the 
unit to be embarked. If the embarking unit is in the same square as the 
vehicle then it will embark immediately. If the embarking unit is not in the 
same square as the vehicle then the vehicle will move to the square and load 
the unit during the COMBAT PHASE. It is possible to instruct a vehicle to 
embark all of the units in a formation. Type the letter "A" instead of the 
index number of the passenger unit. The vehicle must be assigned to the 
formation it is loading in this manner. The vehicle will immediately embark 
the units in the same square and then move to the locations of the other 
units (In numerical order) and load them during the subsequent COMBAT PHASES. 
If a vehicle unit receives new movement (or embark) orders, then it will 
cancel any previous embark orders that have not been completed.
5.5  Movement Objectives:
Movement objectives may be assigned to the current unit by moving the 
cursor to the desired objective location, pressing the (M) key and then 
entering the desired speed.
Each unit may store up to 2 movement objectives. The FIRST OBJECTIVE 
will always be the first objective assigned and the SECOND OBJECTIVE will 
always be the LAST one assigned. When a unit completes its move to the first 
objective location then the second objective will become the NEW first 
objective. If a new objective is assigned to a unit that already has two 
objectives, then the new objective will replace the old second objective. 
Command control movement delays are imposed each time a new movement 
objective is assigned. Delays are not cumulative; the new delay will replace 
any existing delay.
Movement objectives for the current unit may be reviewed by pressing 
the (O) key. Movement objectives for the current unit may be cancelled by 
pressing the (K) key.
5.6  Requesting Artillery Bombardments:
Indirect fire artillery bombardments may be performed by all mortars, 
off-map artillery, and the German Hummel and Wespe units. Any unit on the map 
may REQUEST a bombardment.
To request a bombardment move the cursor to the desired target square 
and press the (B) key. The computer will list units that are in range and 
capable of performing bombardments. If you wish to assign the displayed unit 
to the bombardment mission press the (A) key. If you wish to skip to the next 
unit without assigning the displayed artillery unit then press the (N) key. 
If you wish to exit the bombardment routine press the (Q) key.
For each artillery unit displayed during the bombardment routine, the 
computer will display the DELAY required before the artillery can start 
firing. The delay is dependent on the relationship between the requesting 
unit and the artillery unit:
(1)  If the requesting unit is an HQ and the artillery unit is part of 
the same formation, then there will be a 2  pulse delay.
(2)  If the requester is a non-HQ but the artillery is part of the same 
formation, then there will be a 4 pulse delay.
(3)  If the artillery is in the same formation as the COMMAND HQ, there 
will be a 6 pulse delay.
If none of the above cases apply, then there will be an 8 pulse delay. 
If more than one of the above cases apply, then the one with the shortest 
delay will be used. Off-map artillery is considered to be in the same 
formation as the COMMAND HQ.
When a unit is ordered to bombard, or when a mortar unit begins to 
fire, the unit's maximum firing range is set to zero. Do not change this 
until the bombardment is completed; otherwise the unit may cancel its 
bombardment.
5.7  Setting Target Selection Range:
Units will automatically select direct fire targets during the combat 
phase. The players may prevent their units from selecting targets at extreme 
ranges by adjusting the unit's target selection range. The target selection 
range may be adjusted by using the (R) routine.
EXAMPLE: A Panther tank unit has its selection range set to 5; the unit 
will only select targets at ranges of 5 or less even though the Panther's 
weapon has a maximum range of 15.
5.8  The Inspect Routine:
The (I)NSPECT routine may be used to review all enemy units that can be 
seen by the current unit. The cursor will move to the position of each 
sighted enemy unit and the player will be allowed to request a bombardment or 
designate the enemy unit as a PRIORITY TARGET for the current unit.
The priority target feature allows the player(s) the option of 
controlling the target selection of their units. If the priority target 
feature is not used then the units will automatically select targets during 
the combat phase.
5.9  Ending the Game:
The player(s) may use the (0) routine on the map display menu to end 
the game at any time. The computer will automatically end the game after turn  
30 for assault scenarios and after turn 20 for all other scenarios. Players 
who wish to continue playing a game beyond its normal limits may do so.
5.10  Time:
During the combat phase, 2 minute of actions are resolved. The combat 
phase is divided into 4 PULSES of 30 seconds each,
5.11   Execution Delays:
When units receive new movement or bombardment orders there will be a 
delay, expressed in PULSES, before the orders can be executed (see 5.5, 5.6, 
5.12). Units that use the (K) cancel routine will have a 1.pulse delay added. 
A delay will be added to a carrier that disembarks units (1 pulse per unit 
disembarked).
5.12   Command Control:
Both players will start with a COMMAND HQ unit. For the Allied this
will be a corps unit with a "xxx" symbol ("xx" on the Atari). For the Germans 
this will be a regiment unit with a "III" symbol).
A unit is considered to be "in command control" if an unbroken "chain 
of command" exists between the unit and the COMMAND HQ. To determine command 
control the computer will examine each link in the chain of command.
To establish a command control link between a non-HQ unit and its 
formation HQ, the unit may not be more than 10 spaces from the HQ. If the 
unit cannot" see"  the HQ, then the maximum distance is 5 spaces.
To establish a command control link between an HQ unit and its next 
higher HQ, the higher HQ need only exist somewhere on the map.
EXAMPLE: For an infantry platoon to be in command control it would have 
to establish a command control link with its company linked with its 
battalion HQ and the battalion linked with its battalion HQ and the battalion 
HQ would have to be linked to the command HQ.
To determine the chain of command for any unit, use the (H) routine 
from the unit orders menu. Continue pressing the  (H) key until the cursor 
moves to the command HQ.
Units that receive new movement orders will be delayed a number of 
pulses  before they start moving. The length of the  delay varies with the 
time period, nationality, and command control status of the unit.
Listed below are the movement delays for each nationality, time period 
and command control status (IN COMMAND CONTROL/OUT OF COMMAND CONTROL) .
   TIME
  PERIOD      GERMAN    ALLIED
11/53/7
21/53/7
31/53/7
42/62/6
52/62/6
There is a 33% chance that a player's movement delays will be increased 
by 1 and a 33% chance it will be increased by 2 for any given scenario.
EXAMPLE: In a time period 1 game, the German player will have delays of 
either 1/5, 2/6, 3/7.

6.1   Special Infantry Weapons:
All infantry PLATOONS in the game are armed with one of the following 
Special Infantry Weapons (SIWs): FLAMETHrower, or PanzerFAUST, BAZOOKA, PIAT 
or GRENADE. All SMG and RIFLE units that do not have an SIW will 
automatically be considered to have GRENADEs (although this will not be 
printed on the screen). SIWs will only be used when firing at ZERO RANGE 
against ARMORED VEHICLES and will shoot at the back armor of the vehicle. 
SIWs will be fired instead of the platoons' normal RIFLE or SMG weapons. When 
using SIWs, the number of weapons firing is equal to NUMBER OF MEN in the 
platoon divided by: 1 plus the number of machine guns on the target vehicle 
(except when using grenades in which case the number of weapons is equal to 
the number of weapons is also divided by 5). When SIWs are used, the target 
unit automatically receives 50% suppression.
PZFAUST and FLAMETH weapons may only fire once during the game after 
which they will be replaced by the GRENADE as the platoon SIW.
7.0  COMBAT PHASE
The combat phase of each turn represents 2 minutes of real time. The 
combat phase is divided into four 30-second pulses. During each pulse units 
may search, select targets, fire their weapons and/or move. Before each       
pulse the computer selects one player's units to move and fire first during 
the pulse. The side with the lowest command control delay rating will be more 
likely to move first.
7.1 Searching:
At the start of each pulse eligible units will attempt to spot enemy 
units within their "field of vision". The held of vision is determined by the 
unit's facing and its movement status. Moving units have a 90 degree field of 
vision in the direction they are facing. Non-moving units have a 180 degree 
field of vision in the direction they are facing.
The enemy unit will be spotted if (1) It is within the searching unit's 
field of vision, (2) there is an unobstructed line-of-sight and (3) the enemy 
unit is within sighting range.
The  SIGHTING RANGE equals the enemy unit's SL rating plus 1. If the 
enemy  unit is in cover terrain then the sighting range is divided by 3. If 
the enemy unit is  moving then the sighting range is tripled. The sighting 
range may never exceed the Visibility Level (set at the start of the game).    
Units that previously selected a target will not search if they are 
still eligible to fire at that target. Units may be unable to search due to 
suppression.
Only units visible to the enemy will be shown on the screen during the 
combat phase. EXCEPTION: When playing against the computer, your units will 
always be displayed (although not necessarily sighted by the computer), and
when the computer is playing both sides, the attacking side's units (or German
units in a meeting engagement) will be displayed.
7.2  Selecting Targets:
After searching, a unit will automatically attempt to select a target. 
A target must be a sighted enemy unit that is within target selection range 
(see 5.7). If there is more than one available target then the nearest unit 
will be targeted. If the searching unit has an armor-piercing weapon (MP 
rating greater than 0) then it will select the nearest ARMORED VEHICLE, if 
one is in range.
Tanks and infantry may fire on the same pulse they select a target. 
Assault guns, tank destroyers and artillery (mortars, anti-tank guns, 
infantry guns, flak, howitzers, self-propelled artillery) may not fire on the 
same pulse they select a target unless they  are in the same square as the 
target.
Units will select another target if their current target is an infantry 
unit with a suppression level of 200 at a range greater than zero. A unit 
will automatically change  targets in order to shoot at an enemy unit that 
enters its square.
7.3  Direct Fire vs. Armored Vehicles:
Direct fire may kill or suppress armored vehicles. Armor-piercing fire 
against an armored vehicle will not cause suppression unless the range is 
less than 6 and the firing unit is a vehicle with machine guns. Small arms 
fire from SMG and RIFLE platoons cannot kill armored vehicles.
The effectiveness of direct fire against armored vehicles is determined 
by (1) weapon accuracy, (2) the number of weapons in the firing unit, (3) 
shell size, and (4) armor vs. penetration.
ACCURACY:  At zero range, accuracy will be (90 + (WEAPON ACCURACY x 
PULSE FIRED AT TARGET) SQUARED/100. At maximum range accuracy will be (WEAPON 
ACCURACY x PULSES FIRED AT TARGET) SQUARED/100. Weapon accuracy ratings are 
listed in section 6.0. The pulses fired at the target can never be greater 
than 4. Accuracy is HALVED if the target unit occupies a TOWN, WOODS or 
BROKEN terrain square and has its current speed set to 0. Accuracy is HALVED 
if the target is a MOVING vehicle. Accuracy is multiplied times the TARGET 
SILHOUETTE/4. When anti-tank fire is used against armored vehicles, the 
target silhouette may be adjusted due to range. The following formula is used 
to increase the target silhouette when the range is under 6: 6 - range. This 
adjustment is added to the normal silhouette of the target, but is not    
used when determining the accuracy of special infantry weapons.
KILLS:  Armored vehicles are rated for both front and back armor. Front 
armor (FA) protects the front 90 degrees of the vehicle (see diagram). Back 
armor protects the remaining 270 degrees of the vehicle. When firing at a 
range of zero, it is assumed that the fire is directed at the back armor of 
the target. Weapons are rated for maximum penetration (MP). MP ratings are 
modified  by range and shell size (SS) into an ADJUSTED PENETRATION FACTOR 
(APF). The formula for APF is: (SS x SS) / 4 + MP - MP x (RANGE / MAX RANGE) 
/ 2. The APF may not exceed 2 x ARMOR. If the APF is less than 1.25 x ARMOR 
then the ACCURACY is HALVED. If the APF is less than ARMOR then the ACCURACY 
is HALVED again. The number of KILLS equals  (APF x ACCURACY x NUMBER OF 
WEAPONS FIRING) / (ARMOR X 1200).
EXAMPLE: Let's assume that 5 PZ-IIIJ tanks and 5 Shermans are in clear 
terrain exchanging fire at a range of 3, with each target's front armor 
facing the enemy. The ACCURACY of the PZ-IIIJs is:
= ((((5/8) x 90) + (8x1)) squared)/100
= (64.25 x 64.25) / 100
= 41.28
This accuracy is adjusted by the target silhouette which is equal to 7 
(T-34C has a silhouette of 4 which is adjusted to 7 due to the range of 3) . 
So the adjusted accuracy is equal to 72.24 (41.28 x (7/4)). The APF of the 
PZ-IIIJs is:
=((3 x 3) / 4) + 10 - ((10 x (3 / 8)) / 2)
= 9 / 4 + 10 - 15 / 8
= 10.375
Since the APF is not greater than 1.25 times the Sherman front armor of 
11, the accuracy of 72.24 is cut in half to 36.12. Since the APF is not 
greater than the T-34C front armor of 11, the accuracy of 36.12 is cut in 
half to 18.06. The number of kills due to the fire of the PZ-IIIJs is:
= (10.375 x 18.06 x 5) / (11 x 1200)
= .071
This means that there is roughly a 7.1 chance that one Sherman will be 
destroyed.
If the same calculation was made for the fire of the 5 Shermans the 
result would be a kill number of .612 which would often lead to 1 PZ-IIIJ 
destroyed. Due to the thick armor of the Shermans, an engagement of this type 
would quickly lead to a German defeat. If, however, the German player had 5 
PZ-IVHs, they would fire with a kill number of .614 while the Shermans would 
return fire with a kill number of .535. This is a much better situation for 
the German player.
7.4  Direct Fire vs. Non-Armored Targets:
The effectiveness of direct fire against nonarmored targets is 
determined by (1) weapon accuracy, (2) the number of weapons in the firing 
unit, (3) shell size, and (4) target defense strength.
ACCURACY: Calculated the same as in 7.3 with the following exceptions: 
(1) when firing at MOVING non-vehicle targets the accuracy is DOUBLED instead 
of halved; (2) accuracy is QUARTERED if the target is DEFENDING IN WOODS, 
TOWN or BROKEN terrain irrespective of the unit's current speed setting; (3) 
accuracy is not affected by the target silhouette.
KILLS: Number of KILLS equals (SS x SS x ACCURACY x NUMBER OF WEAPONS 
FIRING) / (DEFENSE x 1000).
If the firing unit is in the same square as the target unit and the 
target's suppression level is greater than 99%, then the target will defend 
with a DEFENSE of 1.
If the firing unit is an armored vehicle and the range is less than 6 
then the attacker will add its MG strength to enhance the attack. Each MG is 
the same as the HMG listed in 6.0.
If the firing unit is moving, then the accuracy is divided by 5 (unless 
range is 0).
7.5   Indirect Fire:
All bombardments and all mortar fire constitute indirect fire. Indirect 
fire will not yield reports of kills and suppression; however, it will report 
when a unit has been eliminated. The effectiveness of indirect fire is as 
determined by (1) the view of the spotter, (2) shell size, and (3) target 
defense strength or armor. For indirect fire, armored vehicles have ARMOR 
equal to BACK ARMOR + FRONT ARMOR / 3.
ACCURACY: Calculated the same as 7.3 and 7.4 except for the following: 
(1) the range is always considered to be the weapon's maximum range for the 
purpose of calculating accuracy; (2) the pulses fired at target is equal to 
zero if the spotter unit does not have a line of sight to the target square; 
(3) the pulses fired at target is equal to 1 if the spotter unit cannot see 
an enemy unit in the target square; (4) the pulses fired at target is equal 
to 4 If the spotter unit can see an enemy unit in the target square.
KILLS:  Calculated the same as in 7.3 or 7.4.
Indirect fire attacks each enemy unit in the target square. If a 
friendly unit is present  in the target square then the indirect fire mission 
will be canceled immediately. If the spotter is unable to see the target     
square, or if there are no enemy units in the target square, then the fire 
will eventually "drift" into an adjacent square which will become the new 
target.
Bombardment fire missions will normally continue firing for 4 pulses 
after which the firing units will become available for reassignment.
7.6 Suppression:
Suppression will occur during most direct and indirect fire attacks. 
Non-armored targets may receive up to 200% suppression.  Armored targets may 
receive a maximum of 50% suppression. If a unit is attacked more than once in 
a pulse then its suppression will be cumulative. Suppression will not occur 
if armor-piercing weapons fire at armored targets unless the firing unit is a 
vehicle armed with machine guns and the range is less than 6.
The level of suppression added by an attack is equal to (SS x SS x 
ACCURACY x ACCURACY x WEAPONS  FIRING) / 200. For suppression purposes the 
ACCURACY will always be at least 10.
At the end of each pulse the suppression level of each unit will be 
halved.
7.7  Suppression Effects:
Suppression may affect a unit's ability to search, fire or move.
SEARCH: Units with greater than 99% suppression may not search. If 
suppression is less than 100% then there is a percentage chance, equal to the 
suppression level, that the unit will fail to search. Units will always    
search the square they occupy.
FIRE: The effectiveness of fire is reduced by 1/3 of the level of suppression 
(i.e. a unit with a suppression of 180% will have its fire's effectiveness 
reduced BY 60% (180 / 3).
MOVE:  Units with greater than 50% suppression will be pinned down and unable 
to move. Note that armored vehicles will never have greater than 50% 
suppression.
7.8  Panic:
Units that suffer "kills" during an attack may become routed. The 
chance of routing is equal to KILLS x COMMAND CONTROL DELAY x RANDOM NUMBER / 
SURVIVORS x RANDOM NUMBER. If the unit has a defense strength (for armored
vehicles, this is equal to armor being fired upon) less than 5 then the rout 
chance will be doubled.
If the unit is a non-vehicle then the rout chance will be tripled. 
Modifications to the rout formula are cumulative.
Routed units will cancel all current orders and automatically move at 
full speed directly towards a friendly map edge. Routed units will not 
respond to orders nor will they fire at enemy units. Routed units will
continue moving regardless of their suppression level.
Routed units will have a random chance of rallying at the start of each 
combat phase. The chance of rallying is equal to 2 / (2 + COMMAND CONTROL 
DELAY). If a unit's HQ has been destroyed or routed then the rally chance 
will be divided by 3. When rallied, units will stop and await further orders.
For purposes of panic, a unit's command control delay is equal to its 
"in command control" movement delay.
7.9  Ammunition:
All units will start the game with 40 units of ammunition. Units will 
expend one unit of ammunition each time they fire. Units will be unable to 
fire if their ammunition reaches zero.
7.10  Movement:
At the end of each pulse, eligible units with movement objectives will 
move. Units that fired or were pinned during the pulse will not move.
At the end of each pulse, moving units accumulate movement points equal 
to their current speed setting (see 6.0). Units will spend movement points to 
ENTER each square on their path. Listed below are the rounded off costs to 
enter each type of terrain for each type of unit:

All non-vehicle units are considered to be FOOT units. The SP rating 
given to each unit is very close to being equal to the unit s maximum miles 
per hour speed in clear terrain (when setting speed for a unit you should 
consider the SP rating to be equal to miles per hour).
7.11  Stacking
Units may not move into a square that contains two or more friendly 
units. If a unit attempts to move into a square that already contains two or 
more friendly units, it will remain in its current square. On the next pulse, 
and every pulse thereafter, the unit will continue to attempt to move into 
the overstacked square (completing the move only when the square no longer 
contains two or more friendly units). More than two units may be placed in a 
square during deployment. Passengers unloading in a square may result in more
than two friendly units present in a square.
7.12  Disembarking Under Fire:
When vehicles carrying passengers come under fire they may be forced to 
unload during the combat phase. Any vehicle that suffers 1 or more KILLS must 
immediately unload its passengers. If a vehicle other than a truck or 
halftrack suffers 50% suppression while carrying infantry then it must 
immediately unload.
If a loaded vehicle suffers KILLS then some or all of the passengers 
may also be killed prior to unloading.
7.13  Combat Reports:
During the combat phase the computer will describe the occurrence of 
direct or indirect fire. The computer will report the size and type of shell 
being fired and in most instances the KILL and/or SUPPRESSION results.
Listed below are the criteria for describing the size and type of shell 
being fired:
      SMALL ARMS FIRE:  RIFLE, SMG, HMG
 LIGHT ARTILLERY FIRE:  IG, HOW, MOR, shell size < 5
MEDIUM ARTILLERY FIRE:  IG, HOW, MOR, shell size = 5
 HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE:  IG, HOW, MOR, shell size = 6
    LIGHT CANNON FIRE:  AT, shell size < 3
   MEDIUM CANNON FIRE:  AT, shell size = 3
    HEAVY CANNON FIRE:  AT, FLAK, shell size > 4
       OVERRUN ATTACK:  moving armored vehicles firing from zero range
    FLAMETHROW ATTACK:  FLAMETH fired from zero range
       GRENADE ATTACK:  GRENADE fired from zero range
   PANZERFAUST ATTACK:  PZFAUST fired from zero range
          PIAT ATTACK:  PIAT fired from zero range
       BAZOOKA ATTACK:  BAZOOKA fired from zero range
Armored vehicles with an MP rating of zero are assumed to be firing 
HOWitzer weapons. Armored vehicles with an MP rating greater than zero are 
assumed to be firing CANNON weapons. Kangaroos, Brens, Halftracks and M20 
armored cars are assumed to be firing HMGs.
During direct fire any KILLS or SUPPRESSION will always be displayed.
During indirect fire KILLS or SUPPRESSION will not be displayed.
Whenever a unit uses direct fire, the computer will print out two 
numbers. The number on the left represents the penetration rating of the 
weapon firing. The number on the right represents the defense rating or armor 
of the unit being fired at.
7.14  Sighting Firing Units:
Any unit on the map that employs direct or indirect fire has a random 
chance of being  sighted. The chance of sighting is equal to 2 x TURNS FIRED 
AT SAME TARGET / RANGE TO TARGET.
7.13  Close-Combat Mode:
Armored vehicle or infantry units that are currently moving and have 
their engagement range set to ZERO are considered to be in CLOSE-COMBAT MODE. 
If a unit in in CLOSE-COMBAT MODE is fired upon by a unit within 3 squares
then the close-combat unit will attempt to move into the same square as the 
firing unit before continuing towards its planned objective.
8.0 LINE OF SIGHT
The ability of a unit to see another unit on the map is affected by the 
terrain that lies between them. To determine if one unit can observe another 
the computer will follow the procedures listed below:
(1)  Determine the straight line path from the sighting unit to the target 
unit. This path is the "line of sight" (LOS). 
(2) Determine if the range to the target unit is greater than the visibility 
level, in which case the unit cannot be seen.
(3)  Determine if the LOS is blocked (Preventing observation) or clear       
(Permitting observation). If any square on the LOS path contains "blocking" 
terrain then there is a possibility the LOS will be blocked.
(4)  There are two types of blocking terrain: ELEVATED terrain and COVER 
terrain. Elevated terrain is any terrain on the LOS path that has a higher 
altitude level than both the sighting and target units. Cover terrain 
consists of TOWN, WOODS or BROKEN terrain squares.
(5)  Elevated terrain will always block the LOS. Town terrain squares      
will always block a line of sight. A LOS may be traced through 1 woods square 
that would have otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a second 
woods square. A LOS may be traced through 2 broken squares that would have
otherwise blocked the LOS but will be blocked by a third broken square. A LOS 
may not be traced through one forest and one broken square.
(6)  If the LOS is not blocked and the two units are on the same altitude 
level, then they may observe each other.
(7)  If the LOS is not blocked by ELEVATED terrain and the two units are at 
different altitude levels, then the following formula is used to determine if 
a LOS exists:
LOS is clear if [h - ( d x H / D)] * >= p.
* Rounds off number to nearest integer.
H = height of higher position minus height of lower position.
D = distance from higher position to lower position.
h = height of higher unit.
d = distance from potential obstacle to higher position.
P = height of potential obstacle.
Each square on the path from the higher unit to the lower unit is a 
potential obstacle. Cover terrain will increase the altitude level of a 
square by 1 additional level when  calculating the value of "P"  in the above  
formula. The following diagram shows the  heights of various terrain types on 
a typical map.
The computer is the final judge in determining LOS. Players may use the 
(view key to determine which squares are visible from any particular square).
9.0 HISTORICAL SCENARIOS
9.1  Kasserine - "Turning the tide after Kasserine" (February 22, 1943):
This is 30 turn assault. The Allied command control delay is 3 and the 
German command control is 3. On the 19th of February, 1943, Erwin Rommel's 
Duetsche Afrike Korps (D.A.K.) broke through the American forces defending 
Kasserine Pass. While the 10th Panzer Division turned north towards Thala, 
the remaining elements of D.A.K. moved northwest to capture Tebessa. On the 
22nd of February, these forces encountered CCB of the 1st Armored Division 
dug in on higher ground. The German assault failed to dislodge the GRant
tanks, and the Germans were forced to retreat. Three months later, all German
forces in Africa were forced to surrender.
9.2  Salerno - "The counterattack that failed" (September 13, 1943):
This is 30-turn German pursuit. The Allied command control delay is 4 
and the GErman command control is 2. This German pursuit developed when 
GErman General Vietinghoff discovered a gap between the British X Corps and 
the American VI Corps, which occurred several days after the initial Salerno 
landing. Believing that the Allies were preparing to evacuate the beachhead,
he launched an immediate attack with the forces at hand. This consisted of 
parts of the 16th Panzer Division (2/2 Pz Rgt, parts of the 1/64 PzGd Rgt, 
2/64 PzGd Rgt, and the 16th Rcn Co). These forces struck two battalions of 
the 157th U.S. Infantry Regiment (45th Div), supported by elements of the 
191st Tank Bn and the 645th Tank Destroyer Bn. After heavy fighting around 
the Tobacco Factory, the Germans crossed the Sele River near Persano, and 
drove for the Calore River crossing, hoping to cut off the 36th Division. The 
157th Regiment was decimated, but they delayed the Germans long enough for 
the 36th Division to successfully withdraw to a more defensible position.
9.3   Caen - "The death ride of British armor" (July 18, 1944):
This is a 25-turn Allied assault. The Allied command control delay is 
3, and the German command control is 1. Operation Goodwood was Field Marshal 
Montgomery's attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead, east of Caen. 
The attack was largely an air and armored show, launched shortly after dawn
and preceded by a carpet bombing using over 2000 planes from the Eighth Air 
Force and Bomber Command. The bombing destroyed or disrupted most of 
Kampfgruppe Luck, charged with defense of that sector, but also made the 
terrain difficult for the armor to traverse. Although the German infantry was 
largely destroyed, elements of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion and the 503rd 
Heavy Panzer Battalion survived and delayed British advance. The British 11th 
Armoured Division spearheaded the attack followed by the British Guards and 
the 7th Armoured Divisions. The broken terrain and the delaying German units 
slowed the British long enough for the Germans to launch a counterattack with 
Panthers from the 1st SS Panzer Division. This combined with a further attack 
from the 21st Panzer Division contained the British attack short of its 
objective. The British lost 200-300 tanks 1n the two-day fight, and several 
months were required to rebuild the shattered armored units.
9.4 Celles - "The end of the Bulge" (December Z5, 1944):
This is a 3O-turn Allied pursuit. The Allied command control delay is 
3, and the German command control is 4. By Christmas Day, the advanced guard 
of the German 2nd Panzer Division of the XLVII Panzer Corps had come within 
six miles of the Meuse River. Low on fuel and ammunition, it was awaiting the 
reinforcement of the Panzer Lehr Division. General White in command of CCB of 
the 2nd Armored Division chose this moment to attack south. He divided his 
command into two task forces (A and B) in an attempt to capture Celles and to 
surround the spearhead of the 2nd Panzer Division. His attack was supported 
by elements of the British 29th Armored Brigade attacking from the west. The 
ensuing battle resulted in the near complete destruction of the 2nd Panzer 
Division (the survivors had to abandon their vehicles and walk back to 
Germany), and the end of German hopes of reaching the Meuse.
10.0 GAME LENGTH AND VICTORY CONDITIONS
10.1  Ending the Game:
The game will automatically end upon the completion of the pre-set 
umber of turns for the scenario (see sections 3.9 and 9.0). Players may also 
elect to end the game early if they both agree (use the 0 key), and they may 
also elect to continue a game that has ended. If they elect to continue a 
game that has ended, the computer end the game after an additional 10 turns 
have been completed.
10.2  Victory Conditions:
At the end of the game victory points (VPs) will be awarded as follows:
EACH UNUSED SELECTION POINT........................20
  (maximum of 250 due to unused selection points)
FORCES IN THE OBJECTIVE AREA:
  ARMORED VEHICLE..................................20
  ARTILLERY/TRUCK..................................10
  INFANTRYMAN.......................................5
EACH KILL:
  INFANTRY..........................................1
  HMG...............................................2
  50,81,82MOR.......................................3
  120MOR............................................5
  OTHER ARTILLERY..................................10
  TRUCK............................................10
  ARMORED VEHICLE..................................10
   (Plus FRONT ARMOR)
Only the attacking player receives points for units in the objective 
area. When playing a meeting engagement type battle both players receive 
points for units in the objective area (both players are considered to be the 
attacker).
After the victory points have been totaled the defender's points will 
be doubled (points for unused selection value may be doubled to a value no 
greater than 500).
The computer will divide the total Allied victory points by the total 
German victory points to arrive at a victory ratio. Compare this ratio to the 
following chart to determine the victor:
2.00 and above ..Allied Decisive Victory
1.50 - 1.99 .....Allied Substantive Victory
1.10 - 1.49 .....Allied Marginal Victory.
0.92 - 1.09 .....Draw
0.67 - 0.91 .....German Marginal Victory
0.51 - 0.66 .....German Substantive Victory
0.50 and below ..German Decisive Victory
12.0  STRATEGY NOTES
Deployment
When deploying on defense you should entrench your infantry near the 
forward edge of the objective area in company size positions. Position your 
anti-tank guns and some of your armored vehicles behind this line by 3-5 
squares. Place your mortars and main HQ 5-15 squares behind the infantry on 
hilltops which have clear fields of vision of probable enemy approach routes. 
You are attempting to create a situation in which enemy tanks first encounter 
your infantry positions, and then almost simultaneously receive medium range 
anti-tank fire. Try to keep at least one company of tanks in reserve, 
committing them only once the axis of the main enemy attack is determined. 
When attacking place your infantry in halftracks or on tanks and then set up 
in a tight formation no more than 5-10 squares wide. Consider splitting off a 
task force of one tank company and one infantry company to flank the enemy 
defensive positions.
Command Control.
Be sure to protect your main HQ by placing it in the rear, but keep it 
on a hilltop if possible so that it can call in off-board artillery with a 
minimum delay. Keep your HQ units 1-2 squares behind the units they are 
commanding. Russian tank brigade and infantry battalion HQ's and all German 
battalion HQ's should only be committed to combat when absolutely necessary.
Getting Your Units To Move
A unit will not move as long as it is firing at an enemy unit. In order 
to get the unit to stop firing you must lower the unit's target selection 
range. Stop! It is essential that you understand this concept, as your 
setting it too high may keep the unit from moving as it fires ineffectively 
at distant targets, but setting it too low may cause the unit to continue 
moving into an ambush even as enemy units may appear dangerously close.
Firing on the Move
While moving, a unit may begin to fire on an enemy target. If you wish 
to keep firing at the enemy while taking advantage of cover terrain in the 
unit's square, but you also want to keep the unit s current movement 
objective, set the unit's speed to 0. Even if you don't want to keep the 
current movement objective, it is better to set the speed to 0 than to use 
the (K)cancel command, since the cancel command will eliminate any pulses 
fired at target that may already have accumulated.
Trucks
Never drive loaded trucks within range of enemy fire, as this is the 
quickest way to lose your guns and infantry. Keep them in cover terrain or 
behind hills where they cannot be spotted by enemy artillery observers.
Weapons
At least 50% of the strategy in Battlegroup is derived from the 
differences between weapons systems. It is essential that you study your 
weapons when beginning a scenario, as well as attempt to predict which 
weapons you will face. Try to establish at what range you will attempt to 
engage enemy tanks. For example if you have PZ-IIIJ tanks and expect to face 
T-34/76A tanks, it would be foolish to close to 400 yards, stop and exchange 
fire. The sound strategy would be to obtain back armorshots, or close to 0 
range. However, if you have some 75 or 88 AT guns, it might be wise to lure 
the Russian tanks towards your tanks and then open up with the AT guns at 
medium range as you charge forward with your tanks. The key is understanding 
under what conditions your weapons have an acceptable chance of defeating the 
enemy.
Special Infantry Weapons
Infantry defending in cover terrain cannot be seen until either an 
enemy unit enters its square or the infantry unit opens fire. For this reason 
it is often wise to set the target selection range of defending infantry to 
zero. This will allow the infantry to ambush enemy units that enter its 
square. The weakness of this strategy is that each defending square, once 
discovered, can be attacked piecemeal. When attacking against the 0 range 
strategy, it is best to send Infantry one square ahead of the attacking 
tanks, as it is much better to have your infantry ambushed than your tanks. 
If you don't have time for a slow infantry advance, be sure to put infantry 
on your tanks, for if your tanks are ambushed, at least your infantry will 
dismount and fire back in defense of the tanks. Do not allow infantry with 
grenades to continue firing at your armored vehicles, for with an accuracy of 
25, their ability to hit will triple. This represents the ability of 
unsuppressed infantry to eventually climb on enemy tanks and destroy them 
with light weapons. Grenades represent Infantry close assaulting tanks, in 
which case the thickness of the armor of the defending tank becomes 
insignificant; thus grenades have been given a penetration value of 25.
Suppression
In Battlegroup, once a unit has been fully suppressed (100+), it may 
easily be destroyed by a unit entering its square. The key is to identify 
soft-targets, keep them suppressed, and then send in at least one unit to 
close assault the defender. Using small arms and artillery fire to suppress 
armored vehicles can also be useful, as it can help keep the vehicles from 
acquiring new targets.
The Combined Arms Concept
Battlegroup rewards those who are able to use combined arms tactics. On 
the attack, artillery should be used to suppress and destroy enemy anti-tank 
guns, as well as suppress enemy mortar positions. Infantry is needed to 
suppress and then assault defending infantry positions, as well as help in 
suppressing enemy vehicles. Tanks can be used to destroy enemy vehicles and 
overrun suppressed enemy infantry and gun positions. Armored cars and light 
tanks should be positioned several squares ahead of the assault elements in 
order to spot enemy positions and draw fire from anti-armor weapons, thus 
exposing them to the fire of your artillery. On defense, use infantry to 
ambush tanks and suppress any units that come too close. Artillery can be 
used to keep attacking infantry pinned down, while anti-tank guns attack 
vehicles that are mixing it up with the defending infantry. Tanks should be 
used as a mobile reserve, fighting off major armored thrusts, or 
counterattacking unsupported infantry attacks.
