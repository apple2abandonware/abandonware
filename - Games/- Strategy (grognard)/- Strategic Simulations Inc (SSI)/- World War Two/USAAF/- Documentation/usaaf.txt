1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
U.S.A.A.F. is a simulation of the daylight startegic bombing offensive against
the Third Reich in World War II.  The game covers the period from August 1943
to the end of the war.

1.1 Starting a Game (Apple)
---------------------------
To begin the game, boot side one and the game will begin automatically.  If you
are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple II emulation mode.  After
you have selected a scenario the computer will instruct you to insert side two
of the disk for the remainder of the game.

1.2 Starting a Game (C-64)
--------------------------
To begin the game, insert the game disk into your disk drive.  Type: LOAD "*",8
and press <RETURN>.  When READY appears, type RUN and press <RETURN>

1.3 Starting a Game (Atari)
---------------------------
To begin, boot the Scenario side of your disk.  Before beginning remove all
cartridges from your computer.  Owners of the 800XL will have to hold down the
OPTION key when they turn on their computer to boot the game.  After you have
selected the starting conditions for the game, the computer will ask you to
insert the Game side of your disk.

1.4 Saving a Game
-----------------
At various points during each turn the computer will allow the player(s) to
save a game in progress.  You will need a scratch disk to store the save game
data.  Save game disks may be initialized for SSI use during a game by
following instructions included in the game program.  Each save game disk will
hold approximately 6 games.  Once a game is saved you will be able to restart
it at the point your left off.

1.5 Sound
---------
During the Combat Phase, the players may toggle the sound ON/OFF by pressing
the (O) key.  The new sound status will take effect when the game clock display
is updated.

2.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
=======================

2.1 Parts Inventory
-------------------
    A Game box
    B Rules manual
    C 5 1/4" game disk
    D 2 player aid cards

2.2 The Map
-----------
The game map displays England and Nazi-occupied Europe including the area from
France in the west to Rumania in the east and from Denmark in the north to
Italy in the south.  A 48 x 32 square grid is used to control movement.  Each
square is 33 miles across.
   Terrain features on the map include American Flag symbols that represent
USAAF bases; blue areas represent seas and oceans; black areas represent open
land; green 'x' symbols represent Luftwaffe airfield sites; white 'x' symbols
represent active Luftwaffe airfields (displayed only to the Luftwaffe player);
orange areas represent Axis cities; white striped areas represent neutral
Switzerland.

2.3 Definition of Terms
-----------------------
ACTIVE AIRFIELD
A Luftwaffe airfield site that includes the necessary personnel and equipment
to effectively repair, fuel and arm fighter aircraft.

AIRFIELD SITE
Squares on the map that are eligible to contain active airfields.  There are
over 100 airfield sites on the map and only 48 may be active at any one time.

ALTITUDE
The elevation in thousands of feet that a raid or patrol is assigned to fly in
performing its mission.

DAMAGE
Individual target damage is displayed when reviewing a previous day's operat-
ions.  This number reflects the percentage loss in production of an industrial
target, percentage loss in guns of a flak target or percentage loss in operat-
ing capability for airfield targets.  For scoring purposes an overall damage
level is displayed on the Morning Briefing menu.  This number represents the
cumulative effects of strategic bombing on the German war effort.

EXPERIENCE
A measure of the average amount of flying or combat experience of the pilots in
a Group Gruppe.  Numbers range from 0 (no experience) to over 100 (very
experience).

FEINT
A USAAF mission undertaken for the purpose of deceiving the Luftwaffe into
committing fighters needlessly.

FLAK
Up to 200 heavy and 200 light flak batteries may be used to defend target
cities.  Heavy flak is effective against aircraft flying below 30,000 feet;
light flak is effective against aircraft flying below 6,000 feet.

GROUP
The basic USAAF organizational unit used in the game.  Bomber groups contain up
to 48 aircraft (usually no more than 37).  Fighter groups contain up to 55
aircraft.

GRUPPE
The basic Luftwaffe organizational unit used in the game.  Gruppes contain up
to 50 aircraft.

MORALE
A measure of the spirit and dedication of the pilots and crews of a Group/
Gruppe.  Values range from 20 (demoralized) to over 100 (hungry for action).
Morale is reduced by flying and may be increased by resting.

RANDOM NUMBER
A number randomly determined that is greater than or equal to 0 and less than
1.

ROCKETS
Air-to-air rockets were used primarily to disrupt heavy bomber formations.
Aircraft armed with rockets suffered from greatly reduced manueverability and
were dead meat when opposed by Allied fighters.

SERVICEABLE AIRCRAFT
The number of aircraft in a Group/Gruppe available for immediate operations.
Aircraft may become unserviceable (unavailable) due to battle damage or normal
wear and tear from just flying.

TIME
The passage of time is displayed on a 24-hour game clock during the combat
phase.  At the start of each day, the clock will begin at 520 and will
increment in 10 minute pulses until all USAAF raids have been completed.  Raids
landing at night (after 1700) will suffer higher operational losses.

WEATHER
Weather in the game is expressed as a percentage of overcast or cloud cover.
Cloud cover may adversely after the ability of bombers to locate or accurately
bombe their targets.  Weather will adversely affect the ability of fighters to
locate targets for air-to-air combat.  Aircraft taking off or landing in poor
weather will suffer higher operational losses and USAAF raids forming up in
poor weather may be forced to abort their missions.  During short game
scenarios the overcast levels will be reduced by an average of 20%.

WEATHER ZONES
There are a different weather zones on the map; northwest, north-central,
north-east, southwest, south-central and southeast.  Cloud cover is specifical-
ly defined for each weather zone.  On the average, cloud cover in the south-
west and south-central zones will be 20% less than the other zones on the map.
Flying conditions will be best during the summer months, average during the
spring and fall months, and poorest during the winter months.


3.0 STARTING THE GAME
=====================

3.1 Determining Conditions of Play
----------------------------------
At the start of the game, the player(s) must determine the conditions under
which the game must be played.  On the APPLE version the conditions may be
changed by entering the following numbers:

(1) NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2) 1 DISK DRIVE or 2 DISK DRIVES
(3) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(4) HANDICAP LEVEL
(5) DELAY LENGTH
(6) SELECT SCENARIO

On the ATARI and COMMODORE 64 versions:

(1) NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
(2) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
(3) HANDICAP LEVEL
(4) DELAY LENGTH
(5) SELECT SCENARIO

3.2 Player Determination
------------------------
U.S.A.A.F. may be played by zero, one or two players and this is determined by
the option selected on the opening menu.  For example, if you wish watch a
computer controlled USAAF face a computer controlled Luftwaffe, you should
select the option BOTH COMPUTER.

3.3 Handicap Level
------------------
At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the handicap level (1-5).
The effects of the handicap level are such that LEVEL 1 would significantly
favor the USAAF player and LEVEL 5 will significantly favor the Luftwaffe
player.  LEVEL 3 is the historical level.
   Handicap level will affect the USAAF replacement rate, the ability of Allied
Intelligence to determine critical targets and teh ability of the Axis war
industry to accelerate the development of advanced aircraft types (such as the
ME262A jet fighter).

3.4 Delay Length
----------------
The delay length affects messages displayed during the Combat Phase.  The
greater the delay length, the longer these message will remain displayd.  A
delay length of 1 will speed up the game but will cause the messages to be
difficult to read.  A delay length of 9 will slow the game considerably but
will allow the player(s) maximum time to study the various combat reports.

3.5 Selecting a Scenario
------------------------
The players may select from three different time periods in which to start the
game:

PHASE I   (1 AUGUST 1943)
PHASE II  (1 FEBRUARY 1944)
PHASE III (1 OCTOBER 1944)

It is strongly suggested that beginning players start with a Phase II game.
   In addition to selecting the time period, the player(s) may elect to play
either a Short Game or a Campaign Game.  The Short Game will end after one
month.  The Campaign Game will end when the Axis Industrial Damage Level
exceeds 99 or on 1 August 1945, whichever comes first.  The SHORT or COMPAIGN
decision is not made from the opening menu; it is made after the initial data
has been read from the disk.


4.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY
====================
Each game turn represents one day of real time.  The game turn is divided into
6 phases in which the player(s) may review intelligence reports and then plan
and execute their daily missions.  On the first turn of each new game, the
Luftwaffe morning briefing phase is skipped.

4.1 Luftwaffe Morning Briefing*
------------------------------
The Luftwaffe player may (1) review the results of the previous day's
operations, (2) check the weather forecast, (3) inspect the status of his
fighter gruppes, (4) inspect the status of the German war industries, (5) check
the numbers of aircraft available in the replacement pools, (6) change the
types of aircraft being produced in aircraft factories, (7) review the
production status for each type of aircraft.

4.2 USAAF Morning Briefing
--------------------------
The USAAF player may: (1) review the results of the previous day's operations,
(2) check the weather forecast, (3) inspect the status of his bomber and
fighter groups at each of his bases, (4) inspect the status of the German war
industries.

4.3 USAAF Target Assignment
---------------------------
The USAAF player may: (1) assign bomber and fighter groups to fly raids over
Axis Europe, (2) examine data from previously assigned raids with the option of
canceling unsatisfactory raids, (3) check the weather forecast, (4) examine the
map display.

4.4 Luftwaffe Deployment*
------------------------
The Luftwaffe player may: (1) review the status of his fighter gruppes, (2)
review the status of his active airfields, (3) check the number of heavy and
light flak batteries protecting each of his cities, (4) check the weather
report, (5) assign tactics to his fighter gruppes, (6) move fighter gruppes to
different active airfields, (7) move active airfields to a different airfield
site, (8) move flak batteries to protect different cities.

4.5 Combat Phase - Luftwaffe Situtation Room
--------------------------------------------
The Luftwaffe player may (1) alter the map display to view different portions
of the map, (2) review the size and altitude of any USAAF raids that have been
detected, (3) go to the Luftwaffe Situation Room.
   From the Situation Room the Luftwaffe player may: (1) review the status of
his uncommited fighter gruppes, (2) check the status of his active airfields,
(3) inspect the flak batteries in each of his cities, (4) check the weather
report, (5) assign fighter gruppes to intercept USAAF raids, (6) assign fighter
gruppes to fly patrols over particular areas, (7) instruct fighter patrols to
intercept USAAF raids or change their patrol locations, (8) resume the Combat
Phase.

4.6 Overnight Activity Phase
----------------------------
During this phase the computer will automatically perform various book-keeping
functions such as repairing damage, assigning replacements, calculating the
score etc.


5.0 LUFTWAFFE MORNING BRIEFING
==============================

5.1 Yesterday's Operations
--------------------------
For each raid flown the previous day the computer will list:

(1) TARGET: if the target was a city then the city name will appear, otherwise
            AIRFIELD FLAK FEINT or DEEP ESCORT will be shown.
(2) BG: number of USAAF bomber groups included in the raid.
(3) BL: USAAF bombers lost due to air-to-air combat or flak.
(4) FG: number of USAAF fighter groups included in the raid.
(5) FL: USAAF fighters lost due to air-to-air combat or flak.
(6) IG: the number of times the raid was intercepted by Luftwaffe fighter
        groups.
(7) IL: the number of intercepting Luftwaffe fighters destroyed in air-to-air
        combat.
(8) TD: target damage percentage.
(9) C: class code of target (A-L) will be shown for city targets to indicate
       the type of target bombed within that city.

       A. railyard (Overlord)
       B. ball bearings
       C. chemicals
       D. oil
       E. aviation gas
       F. electric power
       G. steel
       H. rubber
       I. U-boat
       J. armaments
       K. aircraft
       L. V-weapon

USAAF losses shown on this display may be inaccurately reported (usually higher
than actual losses).

5.2 Weather Report
------------------
Lists the predicted cloud cover for each or the six weather zones on the map.

5.3 Air Group Status
--------------------
Lists the following data for each available Luftwaffe fighter gruppes:

(1) ID: gruppe identification number
(2) GROUP: the historical gruppe designation
(3) AS: aircraft serviceable
(4) AU: aircraft unserviceable
(5) EX: experience rating
(6) MO: morale rating
(7) TYPE: type of aircraft used by the gruppe
(8) the gruppe's airfield ID number will be displayed at the right edge of the
    screen.

* indicates the game may be saved following this phase


5.4 Industry Status
-------------------
The Luftwaffe player may inspect the status for each type of industry.  For
each city containing the selected industry the computer will display the city
ID number, city name and production level for that city.  A total industry
level will be displayed at the bottom of the list.  The number to the right of
the slash is the unadjusted industry level.  The number to the left is the
industry level adjusted for critical industry damage (except for the aircraft
industry).  The adjusted levels will be set to 100 at the beginning of each
game.

5.5 Replacement Aircraft
------------------------
The player may inspect the number of replacements for each type of aircraft.
For each type of aircraft available the computer will display the type ID
number, type designation and the quantity of aircraft available as replace-
ments.
   The Replacement Aircraft routine may be used to change the type of aircraft
being used by a particular gruppe.  This is done by exchanging the aircraft
currently used by the gruppe for a different aircraft type available in the
replacement pool.  The USAAF player may not exchange fighters for bombers or
bombers for fighters.
   Type in the gruppe ID# for the gruppe you wish to change, then enter the
type ID# to indicate the new type of aircraft.  The old aircraft will be added
to those of the same type already in the replacement pool.  The new aircraft
will be subtracted from the replacement pool and added to the exchanging gruppe
in UNSERVICEABLE condition.  The exchange transaction will not be allowed if
the replacement pool does not contain adequate numbers of the selected type to
allow a 1 for 1 exchange.
   The exchange procedure will result in a reduction of pilot experience.  When
exchanging for aircraft of the same class (i.e. single engine for single engine
), there will be a loss of 20% of the group's experience points.  When exchang-
ing for aircraft of a different class (i.e. single engine for twin engine),
there will be a loss of 50% of the group's experience points.

5.6 Aircraft Production
-----------------------
The Aircraft Production routine may be used to examine or alter the types of
aircraft being produced in a particular city.  The computer will display all
cities that include aircraft factories.  The player must enter the city ID# for
the city he wishes to examine/alter.
   Aircraft cities contain three production slots.  Each slot will contain an
aircraft type or will be empty.  Aircraft cities with only one slot in use will
devote their entire production to that one type of aircraft.  Aircraft cities
with two slots in use will devote half of their production to each of the two
listed types of aircraft.  Aircraft cities with all three slots in use will
devote one third of their production to each of the three listed types of
aircraft.
   The Aircraft Production routine may be used to add a new type of aircraft to
an empty slot, remove an aircraft type to create an empty slot or change an
occupied slot to a different type of aircraft.  The player must be enter the
type ID number for the new aircraft type and the slot number that is to be
altered.  Aircraft type ID numbers are listed in section 12.0.  If you wish to
remove an aircraft type to create an empty slot, just enter aircraft type
number '0' for a currently occupied slot.
   Altering the production of an aircraft city will reduce the aircraft
production level of that city.  The production level reduction will be
determined as follows:

(1) 60% reduction if subtracting an aircraft type to create an empty slot
(2) 20% reduction if adding an aircraft type to fill an empty slot
(3) 20% reduction if changing an occupied slot to a similar aircraft type
    (i.e. ME109G changed to ME109K).
    Note: FW190A, FW190D, FW190F and TA152H are considered to be similar
    aircraft types.
(4) 60% reduction if changing an occupied slot to a non-similar aircraft type

   You cannot change the production characteristies of a city if the city has
a production level less than 5.

5.7 Aircraft Factories
----------------------
The player must select the aircraft type.  The computer will display each city
involved in the production of that aircraft type and the production level
devoted to that type.


6.0 USAAF MORNING BRIEFING
==========================

6.1 Yesterday's Operations
--------------------------
Similar to that described in section 5.1.  On this display the Luftwaffe
fighter losses will be inaccurately reported.

6.2 Weather Report
------------------
Same as that described in section 5.2.

6.3 Air Group Status
--------------------
Similar to that described in section 5.3.  The player must first specify the
base (England, Italy, Tunisia, Libya) whose groups he wishes to examine.

6.4 Industry Status
-------------------
Sames as that described in section 5.4.

6.5 Replacement Aircraft
------------------------
Same as that described in section 5.5.


7.0 USAAF TARGET ASSIGNMENT
===========================

7.1 Assign Raid
---------------
For each raid assigned the USAAF player must perform the following actions:

(1) select raid ID letter (A-Z)
(2) select origin base; the player must determine the base from which the raid
    will begin.  Before 1 OCTOBER 1943, England, Tunisia or Libya may be
    selected.  After 30 SEPTEMBER 1943, England or Italy may be selected.
(3) select target: the following types of targets or missions may be selected:
    A  railyard
    B  ball bearings
    C  chemicals
    D  oil
    E  aviation gas
    F  electric power
    G  steel
    H  rubber
    I  U-boat
    J  armaments
    K  aircraft
    L  V-weapon
    M  Overlord
    N  flak
    O  airfield
    P  feint
    Q  deep escort
(4A) select target city: the computer will list all cities that contain the
     selected target type.  The palyer must choose the city to be bombed.  This
     applies only to target types A-M.
(4B) select target point: the map will be displayed with the cursor over the
     starting base.  The player must move the cursor over the target to be
     bombed and press the (X) key.  If the target type is FLAK then the cursor
     should be placed over a city square.  If the target type is AIRFIELD, then
     the cursor should be placed over an airfield site square.  If the target
     type is FEINT, then the cursor may be played anywhere.  This paragraph
     applies only to target types N.O.P.
(5)  select secondary target city: secondary target type must be the same as
     the primary target.  Selection of secondary targets is optional.  This
     paragraph applies only to target types A-M.
(6)  select offset point: the computer will display the map with the cursor
     over the primary target location.  Move the cursor to the desired offset
     point and press the (X) key.  The raid will fly through the offset while
     returning to its base.  If the raid bombed a secondary target or if it is
     shuttling to a different base, then it will not fly through the offset
     point AFTER it has bombed or passed through the target point.  If an
     offset point is not desired, then press the (X) key without moving the
     cursor from the target square.  Applies to target types A-P.
(7)  shuttle to different base: only heavy bombers (B17F, B17G, B24D, B24J) may
     fly to a base that is different than the origin base.
(8)  select bomber type and assign bomber groups: the player may include as
     many of his available groups as he wishes in a single raid.  Different
     types of bombers may be combined in the same raid.  Heavy bombers may not
     fly in flak attack or deep escort raids.  A group (fighter or bomber) must
     have at least 10 serviceable aircraft in order to fly a mission.
(9)  select fighter type and assign fighter groups: fighter groups that fly in
     the same raid as bomber groups will act as 'close escort' protection
     against enemy fighters.  Fighter groups in deep escort missions are not
     required to depart at the same time as the bomber raid they are escorting.
     Deep escorts may join up with the bombers at various points on the route
     to or from the target.  Fighter groups may be used to bomb AIRFIELD, FLAK,
     and RAILYARD (OVERLORD) targets.  Fighter groups will not bomb if they are
     flying in the same raid with heavy bomber groups.  When acting as bombers,
     fighter groups will fly to the target at their assigned altitude dive to
     1000 feet to attack the target, then climb back in the assigned altitude
     for the return to base.
(10) determine which raid to escort: this applies only to deep escort missions.
(11) assign raid altitude: the computer will display the altitude limits for
     each raid.  Raids on AIRFIELD, FLAK, and RAILYARD (OVERLORD) targets may
     not fly over 24000 feet.  For the best results, deep escorts should fly
     1 to 3 thousand feet above the raid they are escorting.
(12) set departure time: may set any time from 600 to 1700 as departure time.
     Deep escorts may not depart BEFORE the raid they are escorting.

7.2 Examine Raid
----------------
This routine may be used to examine data from previously assigned raids.
Included in the raid data display is the range to target (including offset
point), raid speed and climb rate.

7.3 Weather Report
------------------
Same as that described in section 5.2

7.4 Map Display
---------------
The map display may be used as an aid in planning raids.  The cursor may be
moved around the map by pressing keys 1-8 (1=NORTH, 2=NE, 3=EAST, 4=SE, 5=
SOUTH, 6=SW, 7=WEST, 8=NW).  If the cursor is moved over a city square and the
(L) key is pressed then the city name will be displayed.


8.0 LUFTWAFFE DEPLOYMENT
========================

8.1 Fighter Gruppe Status
-------------------------
Same as that described in section 5.3.

8.2 Airfield Status
-------------------
Lists the following data for each active airfield:

(1) AF: airfield identification number
(2) LOC: the x,y location of the airfield
(3) D%: damage percentage, airfields with over 49% damage may not operate
        aircraft
(4) FR: fuel reserve points stored at the airfield.  Each fuel reserve point is
        sufficient to fly 1 aircraft on 1 sortie.
(5) GRUPPE & TYPE: lists the historical designation and type of aircraft for
                   each gruppe based at the airfield

8.3 Flak Status
---------------
For following data will be displayed for each city on the map:

(1) ID: city identification number
(2) CITY: the city name
(3) HVY FLAK: the number of heavy-flak batteries protecting the city
(4) LT. FLAK: the number of light flak batteries protecting the city

8.4 Weather Report
------------------
Same as that described in section 5.2.

8.5 Assign Fighter Tactics
--------------------------
Each day, the Luftwaffe player may alter the tactics assigned to some or all
of his gruppes.  The five tactical options are described below:

(1) ATTACK FIGHTER - BOUNCE
    The gruppe will attempt to engage USAAF fighter groups but will not attack
    unless a positional advantage can be attained.  Will engage bombers if no
    fighters are present.

(2) ATTACK FIGHTERS - DIRECT
    The gruppe will attempt to engaged USAAF fighters and will attack
    regardless of the tactical position.  Will engage bombers if no fighters
    are present.

(3) ATTACK BOBMERS - BOUNCE
    The gruppe will attempt to engage USAAF bombers but will only attack if a
    positional advantage can be attained.  Will NOT engage fighters.

(4) ATTACK BOMBERS - DIRECT
    The gruppe will attempt to engage USAAF bombers and will attack regardless
    of the tactical position.  Will NOT engage fighters.

(5) ATTACK BOMBERS - ROCKET
    The gruppe will attempt to engage USAAF bombers.  Will not attack unless
    the proper rocket launch position can be attained.  Following a rocket
    launch, the gruppe will engage the bombers with cannon fire.  Will NOT
    engage fighters.

    There are two methods for assigning tactics.  THE DEFAULT TACTICS method
    allow a tactic to be assigned to all gruppes with a particular type of
    aircraft.  The SPECIFIC GRUPPE TACTICS method allows tactics to be
    assigned to individual gruppes as desired.

8.6 Move Fighter Gruppe
-----------------------
This routine may be used to move gruppes to different active airfields.  The
player must input the ID numbers for the gaining and losing airfields and
then the ID numbers of the gruppes to be moved.  Gruppes will lose 5% of their
morale each time they are moved in this manner.  The MOVE AIRFIELD routine
contains an alternate (and easier) method of moving fighter gruppes.

8.7 Move Airfield
-----------------
This routine may be used to move active airfields to vacant airfield sites or
move fighter gruppes to different active airfields.

(1) move airfield: move the cursor on the map display to the active airfield
    wish to move.  Press the (G) key to get the airfield.  Move the cursor to
    the new airfield site and press (M) to move the airfield.  The airfield
    move procedure will result in 90% damage to the relocated airfield.
    Airfields may not be moved to sites that are currently occupied by active
    airfields.
(2) move gruppe: move the cursor on the map display to an active airfield.  The
    airfield ID number displayed at the bottom of the text window will be
    inversed if the airfield contains one or more fighter gruppes.  Press the
    (L) key to look at the first gruppe.  If you do not wish to move the
    gruppe then press the (N) key to look at the next gruppe or the (Q) key to
    return to the map menu.  If you wish to move the gruppe you are looking at
    then move the cursor to the desired active airfield and press (M) to move
    the gruppe.  Gruppes moved in this manner will have their morale reduced
    by 5%.

8.8 Move Flak
-------------
This routine may be used to move flak to enhance protection of key cities.
Move the cursor to the 'losing' city and press (T), move the cursor to the
'gaining' city and press (X), then specify the quanties of heavy and light
flak you wish to move.  A maximum of 100 flak batteries may be moved in a
single day.

9.0 LUFTWAFFE SITUATION ROOM
============================
The Luftwaffe player may 'enter' the Situation Room by pressing the (S) key
during the Combat Phase.  In the Situation Room the real time game clock is
frozen while the Luftwaffe player examines his available forces and orders
his various gruppes to intercept detected raids or patrol areas where activity
is expected.

9.1 Fighter Gruppe Status
-------------------------
Similar to that described in 5.3. Gruppes that are flying patrols or intercept
missions will not be displayed.

9.2 Airfield Status
-------------------
Similar to that described in 8.2. Gruppes that are flying patrols or intercept
missions will not be displayed.

9.3 Flak Status
---------------
Same as that described in 8.3.

9.4 Weather Report
------------------
Same as that described in 5.2.

9.5 Intercept Raid
------------------
The detected raids will have their ID letters displayed.  To examine a raid,
press the key corresponding to be raid's ID.  The cursor will move to the
raid's location and the estimated raid size and altitude will be displayed.
   To intercept the raid, move the cursor to a nearby active airfield.  The
computer will display the airfield (AF) identification number and the fuel
reserves (FR) stored there.  If one or more gruppes are located at the base
then the display will show the gruppe ID number, historical designation, number
of serviceable aircraft, type of aircraft, experience and morale ratings for
the first gruppe.
   If you do NOT wish to assign the displayed gruppe to intercept then press
the (N) key to view the next gruppe or the (Q) key to return to the main menu.
   Type the (A) key to assign the displayed gruppe to intercept the raid.  It
is possible to assign more than one gruppe from the same airfield to fly in the
same mission.  Gruppes flying intercept missions will have the option of
returning to a different airfield.  To select a different return airfield move
the cursor to the desired location and press (X).

9.6 Establish Patrol
--------------------
Gruppes are assigned to patrol missions in the same manner that they are
assigned to intercept missions.  Press the (A) key to assign the gruppe to a
patrol mission.  Move the cursor to the desired patrol area and press the (X)
key.  The patrol altitude must be set and the gruppe may be ordered to return
to a different base.

9.7 Patrol Adjust
-----------------
The status of previously assigned patrols may be changed using the Patrol
Adjust routine.  The location and fuel status of the existing patrols will be
displayed one at at time.
   If you do NOT wish to adjust the displayed patrol then press the (N) key to
locate the next patrol or the (Q) key to return to the main menu.
   By pressing the (A) key the player may change the patrol area, altitude and
return base.
   By pressing the (I) key the patrol may be ordered to intercept a detected
raid.

9.8 Luftwaffe Fuel Usage
------------------------
When fighter gruppes are assigned to fly intercept or patrol missions, then 1
fuel point will be subtracted from the airfield fuel reserve for each service-
able aircraft in the assigned group.  If there are more flying aircraft than
fuel reserve points, then the fuel will be reduced to zero and the aircraft
wll fly the mission with their endurance reduced.


10.0 COMBAT PHASE
=================
During the Combat Phase, both players should be at the computer viewing the
action.  The USAAF player should turn away when the Luftwaffe player is using
the Situation Room routines.  Only the Luftwaffe player is allowed to make
keyboard inputs during the Combat Phase.
   Certain equations in this section are printed in a lighter color; beginners
need not read these to play the game.  Intermediate and Advanced players,
however should find that the formulas contribute to a better understanding of
how the computer determines values and percentages.

10.1 Game Clock
---------------
Each day the clock will start at 520 AM and run continuously until all raids
have been completed.  Game time is divided into 10-minute pulses.  Each pulse
all raids, patrols and intercept missions will move, search and possibly engage
in combat.  The Luftwaffe player may stop the clock's progress by using the
Raids display routine or entering the Situation Room.

10.2 Raids Display
------------------
At any time during the Combat Phase the Luftwaffe Player may examine the
detected USAAF raids by pressing the (R) key.  The ID letters for detected
raids will be listed.  To examine a raid, press the key that corresponds to the
raid's location on the map and the raid's estimated size and altitude will be
displayed.

10.3 Changing the Map
---------------------
The U.S.A.A.F. Game Map covers a 48 x 24 square grid.  Only a 20 x 10 area can
be viewed at any one time.  During the Combat Phase, the Luftwaffe player may
alter the portion of the map being displayed by pressing keys 1-9.  The map is
divided into 9 areas that are situated as follows:

          1  2  3
          4  5  6
          7  8  9

Thus by pressing the (1) key, the display will change to show the northwest
portion of the map; by pressing the (9) key, the southeast portion of the map
will be shown etc.

10.4 USAAF Raid Resolution
--------------------------
(1) FORMING UP: the time required to form up is equal to assigned altitude
    divided by the climb rate.  Raids that spend an entire pulse climbing will
    not move during the pulse.  Raids that spend only part of the pulse climb-
    ing will receive partial movement.
(2) MOVEMENT: raids will move in a straight line towards an objective.  A
    movement objective may be either a target or an offset point.  Deep escorts
    will move towards the raid they are designated to escort.
(3) FUEL CONSUMPTION: groups spend 1 fuel point each turn they are in the air.
    Fighter groups spend 4 fuel points each time they participate in air-to-air
    combat.  Fighter groups that exceed their operational fuel limit will turn
    back.  Groups that turn back will be removed from the map.  Groups will
    never be forced to ditch for lack of fuel.
(4) FLAK: raids may be subjected to flak attacks each pulse they spend in a city
    square.  Airfield flak will only fire at raids that are attacking the air-
    field from less than 6000 feet.  Raids flying in the TARGET square will be
    subjected to full strength flak.  Raids flying through a non-target square
    will be attacked by 1/3 strength flak.  Flak is primarily useful in
    disrupting bomber formations before they drop their bombs.
(5) LOCATING THE TARGET: bombers that enter a target square will attempt to
    visually sight the target.  If the visual sighting fails due to cloud cover
    then the raid will proceed towards the secondary target.  If the visual
    sighting fails and no secondary target has been assigned then the bombers
    will attempt to bomb using radar.  Radar bombing will be only 10% as
    effective as visual bombing.  The probability that a raid will fail to
    'sight' the target is equal to the cloud cover percentage in the target's
    weather zone.
(6) OFFSET POINTS: raids will fly through their assigned offset points before
    proceeding directly to the target.  Raids will fly through the offset point
    when returning to base unlesss the following exceptions apply (a) the raid
    is shuttling to a different base. (b) the raid bombed a secondary target.
    Offset points may be useful in flying around heavy flak and fighter
    concentrations or in concealing the intended target until the last moment.
(7) RETURN TO BASE: after dropping their bombs or passing through their target
    points, the raids will set their return course.  Shuttle raids will return
    to their origin base.  Returning raids will be removed from the map when
    they reenter the Allied fighter cover zone (see 11.13).  Bomber raids will
    have their speed increased by 25 mph after dropping their bombs.
(8) RAID DETECTION: The Luftwaffe player will always receive advance notice of
    impending raids.  A 'RAID FORMING UP' message will be displayed immediately
    after a raid takes off from its base.  The 'RAID FORMING UP' message will
    be displayed each 10-minute pulse until the raid is detected.  When a raid
    is detected, the cursor will move to the raid's current location, and the
    raid's estimated size and altitude will displayed.
       Raids that are still within the Allied Fighter Cover Zone will have a
    random chance of detection. (The higher the assigned altitude, the greater
    the chance of detection)   Raids that fly beyond the Fighter Cover Zone
    will be automatically detected.

10.5  Luftwaffe Fighter Mission Resolution
------------------------------------------

(1) TAKING OFF; gruppes that have been assigned to fly or patrol missions must
first spend 1 pulse `on the runway' preparing to take off.  If the airfield is
bombed while the fighters are on the runway then they will abort their
mission.

(2) CLIMBING; following take off the fighters will climb to their assigned
altitudes.  Intercept missions will climb to the same altitude as the raid
they are attempting to intercept.  Fighter missions will suffer the same
movement penalties as those described for USAAF raids.

(3) MOVEMENT; patrol missions will move in a straight line towards their
assigned patrol area where they will remain until: (a) a different patrol
areas is assigned, (b) the patrol is assigned to intercept a USAAF raid, (c)
the patrol sights a raid which it will automatically intercept, (d) the patrol
runs low on fuel and returns to its assigned airfield.  Intercept missions
will move toward the raid they are attempting to intercept.

(4) FUEL CONSUMPTION;  fighter missions will spend 1 fuel point each pulse
they are in the air.  Fighters use 2 fuel points each time they INITIATE
air-to-air combat.  Fighters (but not jets and rockets) use 4 fuel points when
DEFENDING in air-to-air combat. Fighters use 10 fuel points to initiate a
rocket attack.  Fighter gruppes that exceed their operational fuel limit will
turn back.

(5) LANDING & REFUELING; gruppes that turn back will be removed from the map
display and will spend a variable period of time in `landing mode'. The number
of pulses required to land the gruppe is equal to the distance in squares from
the turn-back point to the assigned airfield.  Following the landing interval,
the gruppe will spend an additional 3 pulses refueling.  When refueling is
complete, the gruppe will be ready for reassignment to intercept or patrol
missions.

10.6 Air-to-Air Combat
----------------------
Air-to-Air combat is a two step procedure: combat initiation and combat
resolution.

(1) REQUIREMENTS; only fighters may attempt to initiate air-to-air combat.
Air-to-air combat may only occur between groups that occupy the same square on
the map.  Luftwaffe fighters may only initiate combat against raids they have
been assigned to intercept.  All air-to-air combat situations are resolved as
a single attacking group vs. a single defending group.  If more than one
fighter group exists in the attacker raid/mission then each group will be given
a separate chance to initiate combat.  If more than one group is present in
the defending raid/mission then the defending group will be determined
randomly.

(2) FAILURE TO INITIATE COMBAT; if the requirements for air-to-air combat
exist the fighters may still fail to initiate combat due to poor visibility,
altitude difference or improper positioning.
 (a) visibility - the probability of failure due to poor visibility is equal
     to the percentage of cloud cover in the weather zone.
 (b) altitude - the probabilities of failure due to altitude differences are
     listed below:
          3000 ft or less       0%
          5000 ft              33%
          7000 ft              67%
          9000 ft or more     100%
 (c) position - the probability of failure due to improper position varies
     with the fighters tactics:
          DIRECT                0%
          BOUNCE               70%
          ROCKET               80%
          all USAAF fighters   70%

(3) FIGHTER VS FIGHTER COMBAT RESOLUTION;  combat is resolved by comparing the
`effectiveness' and size of the attacking group with the `effectiveness' of
the defending group.  Fighter effectiveness is calculated as follows:
    effectiveness = maneuverability # X (400 - disruption) / 400 X (experience
    + 100) / 200 X (morale _ 100) / 200

The effectiveness of the attacking group is increased by 50% if it is a USAAF
group attacking from an altitude advantage or a Luftwaffe group using `bounce'
tactics.  The following formula is used to determine the number of POSSIBLE
KILLS suffered by the defender:
    possible kills = defender effectiveness / (1 + attacker effectiveness) X
    number of surviving defender aircraft X random number / 8

After the defender losses have been deducted the number of POSSIBLE KILLS
suffered by the attacker is determined:
    possible kills = defender effectiveness / (1 + attacker effectiveness) X
    number of surviving defender aircraft X random number / 8

(4) FIGHTER VS BOMBER RESOLUTION: fighter effectiveness is calculated as
follows:
    effectiveness = (70 + cannon # X3) X (400 - disruption) / 400 X (experience
    + 100) / 200 X (morale + 100) / 200

The effectiveness of the fighters is increased by 50% when using `bounce'
tactics.  Bomber effectiveness is calculated as follows:
    effectiveness = 50 X (400 - disruption) / 400

The formula used to calculate the number of POSSIBLE KILLS suffered by the
bomber group:
    possible kills = bomber effectiveness / (1 + fighter effectiveness) x
    defensive fire rating # X number of bombers X random number / 24

(5) ROCKET ATTACK RESOLUTION:  rocket attacks may only be initiated by gruppes
that have been assigned BOMBER ATTACK - ROCKET tactics.  The rocket
effectiveness if calculated as follows:
    rocket effectiveness = rocket rating # X number of fighters X experience
    / 100

Effectiveness of rocket attacks is doubled after 30 June 1944.

The number of POSSIBLE KILLS caused by rocket attacks is calculated:
    possible kills = effectiveness X (200 - bomber disruption) / 200 X random
    number / 100

The amount of disruption caused by rocket attacks is calculated:
    disruption = effectiveness X (200 - bomber disruption) / 200

The disruption caused by rocket attacks will have LESS effect against bomber
groups that have been previously disrupted.  Rocket attacks worked best
against tight formations of bombers.

After executing rocket attack the fighters will immediately attack the
same bomber group.  This attack is resolved using the FIGHTER VS BOMBER COMBAT
procedure described above.

10.7 Flak Resolution
--------------------
City flak will fire at USAAF raids whenever they begin their move in the city
square.  Airfield flak will only fire at raids that are attacking that
airfield.  Airfields will always be protected by 50 batteries of light flak.
Cities may be protected by a maximum of 200 heavy and 200 light flak
batteries.

When firing at USAAF raids, flak will attack each group within the raid with
the entire effective flak strength.  Flak effectiveness is calculated:
    effectiveness = heavy flak X (30 - altitude) / 20 + light flak X (6 -
    altitude)
------------------------------
# - see 12.0 for aircraft data


Flak effectiveness is divided by three when firing at a raid that is not in its
target square. Flak effectiveness is divided by three when firing at USAAF
fighters.  The POSSIBLE KILLS resulting from flak are calculated:
    possible kills = effectiveness X Random number / 200 X (200 - disruption)
    / 200

The disruption resulting from flak is calculated:
    disruption = effectiveness X random number X (200 - disruption) / 200

NOTE: Flak will be LESS effective when fired at groups that have been
previously disrupted.

10.8 Possible Kills
-------------------
     During air-to-air combat or flak resolution, messages will be displayed
indicating that aircraft have been destroyed or damaged.  Each of these
messages represents a POSSIBLE KILL.  In determining how many possible kills
have occurred, a random number between 0 and 1 will be added to the `possible
kill' number calculated in 10.6 or 10.7.  Thus if the possible kill number was
calculated as 1.45 then this would be adjusted to TWO 45% of the time and ONE
55% of the time.

Each time a possible kill is reported, the computer will randomly select
one of three possible outcomes; false report, aircraft damaged, aircraft
destroyed.  Listed below are the probabilities of each occurrence:
    33%   false report
    33%   aircraft destroyed
    34%   aircraft damaged
          (compare attacker firepower with defender durability)
In the last occurrence, the damage/destroyed determination is calculated:
DAMAGED if: durability X random number > attacker firepower X random number
DESTROYED if: durability X random number <= attacker firepower X random number

IN FLAK or ROCKET attacks, the firepower will always be 30.  For bomber
defensive fire, the firepower will always be 2.  In all other instances the
firepower will be equal to the fighter's CANNON rating.

10.9 Bombing Results
--------------------
When a USAAF raid bombs a target, the computer will calculate separately the
damage percentage caused by each bomber group.  The effectiveness of a bomber
group is calculated:
    effectiveness = (2 X experience + morale) / 3 X (125 - disruption) / 125 X
    (36 - altitude) / 36 X (200 - cloud cover) / 200
Effectiveness will be doubled if the disruption is less than 6%.

The damage caused by each bomber group is calculated:
    damage = effectiveness X number of bombers X bomb load X random number
    / (target defense X 50)

The `bomb load' is calculated by comparing the bomb rating for that type of
aircraft to the distance in squares flown to the target:
    bomb load = bomb rating # X (50 - disruption) / 50

Fighters that are attacking ground targets add their cannon # to their bomb
load.

Each type of target is rated separately for its defense (durability)
    railyard (Overlord)  6
    ball bearings       12
    chemicals            7
    oil                  9
    aviation gas         9
    electric power      30
    steel               12
    rubber              10
    U-boat              13
    armaments           12
    aircraft            12
    V-weapon            10
    submarine pens      20
    airfields           20
    flak                20
    Nordhausen          50
Submarine pens are the U-boat targets located in Brest, St. Nazaire and
Bordeaux.  Nordhausen was a large underground factory complex.  All target
types located in Nordhausen will have a defense strength of 50.

Target defense strengths for targets with small industrial levels will be
reduced as follows:
   Industrial Level     Defense Adjustment
        1 - 4                X 1/3
        5 - 9                X 1/2
        10+                  X 1

When attacking from altitudes greater than 25000 ft, there is a chance that
some or all of the attacking bomber groups will completely miss the target.
    chance of missing target = (altitude - 25) X (100 - experience) / 500
Each attacking bomber group will roll separately to see if it misses the
target.

When an airfield is damages, aircraft and fuel on the base will also be
damaged.  For each 1% of damage to the airfield, %1 of fuel will be destroyed,
1/1% of the aircraft caught on the ground will be damaged, and 1/2% of the
aircraft will be destroyed.  Fighter attacks on airfields will cause four
times the amount of damage to aircraft as to the airfield itself.

10.10  Switzerland
------------------
Planes flying over Switzerland will be attacked by Swiss forces.


11.0  MISCELLANEOUS
===================

11.1 Calculating Effective Industry Levels
------------------------------------------
The industry levels of each city are combined to find the total industry
level for each type of industry.  The total industry level may be reduced if
that industry is `dependent' on other `critical' industries that have been
extensively damaged.

An industry is considered to be `extensively damaged' if it is reduced
below its `critical level'.  Listed below are the critical industries and the
industries that are dependent on them:

    Critical Industry        Dependent Industries
    -----------------        ---------------------------
    Railyard                 U-Boat, Armaments, Aircraft
    Ball Bearings            Armaments, Aircraft
    Chemicals                Oil, AvGas, Rubber, Armaments
    Electric Power           All Other Industries
    Steel                    U-boat, Armaments
    Rubber                   Armaments

At the start of the game, all critical industries have a critical level
of 50 except for railyards which have a critical level of 100.  I f a critical
industry is reduced below its critical level then the following formula is
used to find the effective industry level:
    effective industry level = dependent industry points X (100 - (critical
    level - critical industry strength) / 100

EXAMPLE: the industry level for chemicals is reduced to 10, the critical level
for chemicals is 50 and the industry level for oil is 100.  The `effective
industry level' for oil will be 60 (- 100 X (100 - (50 - 10)) / 100)

EXCEPTION: extensively damaged railyards will affect the aircraft industry in
a different manner than that described above.  Individual aircraft cities will
be reduced in the following manner if railyards are reduced below 80:
    Reduction       Aircraft Industry Size
     10%            greater than 9
     75%            less than 10

At the end of each turn that a critical industry is below its critical
level there is a random chance that the critical level will be REDUCED by 10.
The chance of reduction is equal to HANDICAP LEVEL / 500.  The 0layers will
not be informed when the critical level has been reduced.

11.2 Calculating Axis Industrial Damage
---------------------------------------
The Axis Industrial Damage Level (AIDL) is used to measure the USAAF player's
success in hindering the Axis war effort.  Damage points are added to the AIDL
when various industries are reduced to various levels.  The matrix displayed
in the chart to the right reflects the points scored for reducing each
industry.
   THE AIDL (DAMAGE) will be displayed at the top of the Intelligence Briefing
menus.

11.3 Aircraft Replacements
--------------------------
Replacement aircraft will be added at the end of each day.  USAAF replacements
will arrive on a fixed schedule.  Luftwaffe replacements will vary with
Luftwaffe players production decisions and the effective aircraft industry
levels.

daylight air defense of the Reich, so the German player will automatically
receive one JU88G per day.
   The daily replacements for each type of aircraft are calculated by comparing
the production rate with the aircraft industry level for that type of aircraft:
   replayments = production rate x industry level / 100

 INDUSTRY        0-19  20-29  30-39  40-49  50-59  60-69  70-79  80-89  90+

 Divide armaments level by 10 before comparing to the damage martix

Daily replacements will be added to the replacement pool.  The replacement pool
may contain a maximum of 255 aircraft of any one type.  The adjusted industrial
level of an aircraft type can never exceed 255.
   Each turn replacement aircraft may be distributed to depleted groups.  A
maximum of 3 aircraft per day will be added to groups that receive replacements
.  All replacement activity is controlled by the computer.

11.4 Luftwaffe Aircraft Availability Certain Luftwaffe aircraft types are not
available at the start of the game (8/43).  Availability dates are listed on
the LUFTWAFFE AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION RATE chart.
   Each month there is a random chance that the availability date for each
aircraft type will be accelerated by 1 month:
   availability acceleretion chance = handicap level x aircraft factories /1000

EXAMPLE: In hope of receiving ME262A jets sooner than 11/44 the Luftwaffe
player has converted 100 aircraft factories to ME262A production.  At handicap
level 3, there will be a 30% chance each month that ME262A availability will be
accelerated.
   The players will not be informed that the availability date has been
accelerated.
   At the start of the Phase III scenarios, the ME262A is available.

11.5 USAAF Allowable Targets
----------------------------
The USAAF player may be limited in the targets, he is allowed to bomb.  At the
start of the game chemicals, electric power and steel industries may not be
attacked.  Each turn there will be a 1/1000 chance that one of these industry
types will become an allowable target.  These industries will automatically
become allowable on the following dates:

   chemicals            6/44
   steel                9/44
   electric power       1/45

11.6 USAAF Political Targets
----------------------------
At various times during the Campaign Games, the USAAF player will be restricted
to bombing specific targets for political reasons.  U-boats, V-weapons and
Overlord (railyards in France, Belgium and Italy) may be seleted as political
targets at various points in the game.
   Only the USAAF bombers based in England (8th Air Force) will be affected by
the political target restrictions.  When a political target has been declared,
no other target types except airfields and flak may be targeted by the 8th Air
Force.  The political target will remain in effect until the USAAF has
inflicted satisfactory damage to the political target industry or the Allied
High Command loses interest in that industry.
   In 1943 and 1945, U-boats may become political targets.  In 1943, unchecked
growth of the sub-pens in France will trigger a political reaction.  A
significant reduction in the sub-pens or the submarine factories will satisfy
the High Command.  In 1945, the advanced U-boat designs may take their toll of
Allied shipping and trigger a political reaction.  At this stage of the war
a 'token' raid against a U-boat factory will satisfy the High Command.
   From April through August 1944, V-weapons may become political targets.
Unchecked growth of 'launch sites' in Cherbourg, Calais and LeHavre may trigger
a political reaction.  A significant reduction in the launch sites or the V-
weapons factories will satisfy the High Command.
   During May through August 1944, the USAAF must assist in preparation for the
invasion of France.  During this period, the USAAF must reduce the Overlord
railyards to less than 15 total points.

11.7 Flak Production
--------------------
Flak replacements are produced in cities with armaments factories.  Each day
there is a chance that new flak batteries will be added to armaments cities.
The formula for adding flak is as follows:
  new flak = armaments industry level + 100 x random number / 100 (fractions
  rounded down)

EXAMPLE: if the city armaments level is 60, there is a 60% chance that 1 heavy
flak battery will be added a 40% chance that no heavy flak will be added.  The
procedure would be repeated to determine light flak reinforcements.

EXAMPLE: if the city armaments level is 140 there is a 40% chance that 2 heavy
flak batteries will be added and a 60% chance that only 1 heavy flak battery
will be added, etc.

   For the purpose of determining flak reinforcements, the armaments industry
level is NOT affected by damage to critical industries.

11.8 Airfield Fuel Replenishment
--------------------------------
Each day the effective industry total for aviation gas will be added to the
National Aviation Fuel Reserve (NAFR; this number will not exceed 200).  Also,
each day a number of fuel points equal to the handicap level will be added to
the NAFR.  If the NAFR total is greater than 99 then airfield fuel replenish-
ment will occur.
   Fuel replenishment will only affect active airfields that contain at least
1 fighter gruppe and with damage less than 50%.
   Airfields with less than 101 fuel will add 100 fuel points and 2 points will
be subtracted from the NAFR.
   Airfields with less than 151 fuel will add 50 fuel points and 1 point will
be subtracted from the NAFR.

11.9 Reinforcement Groups
-------------------------
Reinforcement groups will become available during the game in accordance with
the Reinforcement Schedule (see 13.0).
   New reinforcement groups will only be received if there are adequate numbers
in the aircraft replacement pool to 'buy' the new group.  Certain Luftwaffe
gruppes represent transfers from other fronts.  Transfered reinforcement
gruppes are not 'bought' from the replacement pool.

11.10 Experience
----------------
Fighter groups add 1 experience point each time they participate in air-to-air
combat.  Groups add 1 or 2 experience points each time they bomb a target.
Groups with experience less than 50 will automatically gain 1 experience per
turn.  However if the German fuel reserve is less than 100, their gruppes will
not receive this automatic experience gain.  Groups with experience less than
71 gain experience for just flying:

           CURRENT          EXPERIENCE
          EXPERIENCE          GAINED
           51-70                1
           31-50                2
            0-30                3

Groups with experience greater than 90 lose experience for just flying:

           CURRENT          EXPERIENCE
          EXPERIENCE          LOST
           91-110               1
          111-130               2
            131+                3

Groups will lose experience when replacements are added.  USAAF replacement
crews will have experience equal to 2/3 of the experience rating of the group
they are joining.  Luftwaffe replacements will have experience equal to zero.
   The computer will keep track of how many pilots are available in Luftwaffe
fighter gruppes.  When German aircraft are destroyed in combat, there is 50%
chance that the pilot will be lost.  When German aircraft are destroyed during
takeoffs or landings the pilot will always be lost.  Replacement pilots will
be added (and experience will be reduced) only when there are more serviceable
aircraft than there are pilots in a gruppe.

11.11 Morale
------------
At the end of each day groups with morale ratings less than their experience
ratings will add 2 morale points for USAAF groups and 4 morale points for USAAF
groups and 4 morale points for Luftwaffe groups.  Groups lose 5% of their
morale each time they fly.  Groups lose 5% of their morale for each aircraft
destroyed in combat.  Luftwaffe gruppes that are bombed on the ground will lose
1 morale point for each point of damage the airfield sustains.

11.12 Building Industry
-----------------------
At the end of each day there is a chance that cities will increase their
industry strength.  The table below shows the chance for building industry
strength and the optimum level for each type of industry:

 TYPE                  BUILD         OPTIMUM
 railyard (Overlord)     8%             2
 ball bearings           5%             5
 chemicals               5%             6
 oil                     7%             5
 aviation gas            7%            10
 electric power          1%             3
 steel                   2%             8
 rubber                  5%            10
 U-boat                  3%             8
 armaments              *4%            50
 aircraft               *4%            50
 V-weapon                4%            10

* The build chance for armaments will increase to 12% and the build chance for
aircraft will increase to 20% starting 1/44.

   If the industry strength for a city is equal to ZERO then the build chance
will be divided by 5.  If the industry strength for a city is greater than or
equal to the optimum level then the build chance will be divded by 5.  If the
industry strength is greater than 3 x optimum level then the industry strength
may not be increased.
   The build chance for all industries will be reduced by 1% for each point
that STEEL is reduced below 25.  Thus if steel is reduced to 10 points then new
industries will build only 85% as fast as normal etc.
   A city will only build types of industry that are in that city at the start
of the game.  Thus Nordhausen which starts the game with only aircraft and
V-weapon industries will only build aircraft and V-weapon industry during the
game.  EXCEPTION: At the start of the game there are certain cities with
industrial sites for ball bearings, aircraft and V-weapons under construction.
These industries may build during the game even though they started with a
strength of zero.

11.13 Allied Fighter Cover Zones
--------------------------------
Certain areas of the map will be designated as Allied Fighter Cover Zones (see
player aid map).  Luftwaffe aircraft may not enter a fighter cover zone and
USAAF raids will be more difficult to detect while flying through these zones.
   At the start of the game (8/43), the fighter cover zone will be limited to
the area in and around England.  During the game, fighter cover zones will
expand to cover the following areas:

SOUTHERN ITALY                   10/43
NORMANDY                          6/44
CENTRAL ITALY, FRANCE, BELGIUM    9/44

11.14 Advancing Allies
----------------------
During the campaign games certain areas that start the game in German control
will be captured by the advancing Allied Armies.  These areas will include the
Allied Fighter Cover Zone areas described in 11.13.  In addition the Soviet
Armies will overrun EASTERN EUROPE in 9/44 (the area east of Warsaw, not
inclusive).
   In areas captured by the Allies, all German industry, flak and active
airfields will be destroyed.  Fighter Gruppes based on captured airfields will
be removed from the game and returned as reinforcements within 2 months.

11.15 Jet and Rocket Aircraft
-----------------------------
The following special rules apply to Luftwaffe jet (ME262A, HE162A) and rocket
(ME163B) aircraft.

(A) Fuel Consumption: jets and rockets do NOT require or consume fuel points
when flying combat missions.  These aircraft did not use the specially refined
aviation gas that the piston engined fighters used.  Jets and rockets do not
expend fuel when defending against USAAF fighter groups.

(B) Air to Air Combat: when jets and rockets engage in air to air combat they
will suffer 1/20 of the 'possible kills' calculated in 10.6.  This applies when
encountering USAAF fighters or bomber defensive fire.

14.0 VICTORY DETERMINATION
==========================

14.1 Calcuating the Score
-------------------------
In all scenarios (both short and compaign) the USAAF player's base score will
equal the AIDL (see 11.12).
   In short scenarios the FINAL SCORE will be equal to the AIDL x loss ratio.
In the campaign game the FINAL SCORE equals 12 + 4 x the number of months
before May 1945 that the game ended (if the game ends after May 1945 this will
be a negative number).

14.2 Loss Ratio
---------------
The loss ratio is calculated:

loss ratio = Luftwaffe fighter losses x 2 / (2 x USAAF bomber losses + USAAF
             figher losses).

In Phase III games, divide the loss ratio by 2.  In all games, if the number of
bombers destroyed is less than 1000 and the loss ratio is less than 1.0 then
the loss ratio will be increased to 1.0.

14.3 Victory Levels
-------------------
The final score is compared to the following chart to determine the level of
victory for each scenario:

15.0 SCENARIOS
==============
The players may select from three time periods or 'Phases' at the start of the
game.

15.1 Phase I
------------
Starts 1 August 1943.  The USAAF has been in action against Germany for over a
year but has only recently received bombers in sufficient quantities to fly
'deep penetration' raids.  USAAF fighters consist of the short winded P47B and
the awkward P38G.
   In response to the growing USAAF threat, the Reich Air Defense has been
heavily reinforced with gruppes from the Mediterranean and Eastern Fronts.
Experienced German pilots flying ME109G and FW190A fighters are more than a
much for their USAAF opponents.  Heavily armed ME110G, ME410A and JU88G
'destroyer' aircraft have been introduced to deal exclusively with USAAF bomber
formations.
   When playing the Phase I SHORT game it is recommended that experienced
players play the USAAF side.  We also recommend that only experienced players
play Phase I.

15.2 Phase II
-------------
Starts February 1944.  After some serious reverses in the second half of 1943,
the USAAF has reinforced and requipped its fighter groups.  Flying large
numbers of P47Ds and P38Js and a few precious groups of P51Bs, the USAAF can
at last provide escorts continuously to and from the target on deep penetration
raids.
   As the USAAF has gained experience and improved equipment.  Luftwaffe
quality has remained unchanged.  The ME109G is still widely used despite being
outclassed by new USAAF fighter types.  Axis production has been reorganized
and development of advanced fighter designs has begun.

15.3 Phase III
--------------
Starts 1 October 1944.  After crippling the German fuel industries in the
Summer of 44, the USAAF has victory within its grasp.  As the Allied Armies bog
down on the German border it is hoped that strategic bombing can hasten the
collapse of the Axis war machine.
   The Luftwaffe has been reduced to a shambles by the past 9 months of heavy
fighting.  Axis aircraft production has reached record heights but shortages of
fuel and experienced pilots have made this irrelevant.  Luftwaffe hopes rest on
increased availability or advanced fighter types such as the FW190D, ME109K and
ME262A.
   All critical industries have their critical level set to 30.  The ME-262A
has already begun production at the start of Phase III.  When playing the Phase
III SHORT game, it is recommended that advanced players play the Luftwaffe
side.


16.0 STRATEGY NOTES
===================

USAAF Player
------------
Short Games - In the short games you should pick one industry (preferably a
critical industry) that can give you a lot of points quickly and then destroy
that one industry.  Ball bearings and/or rubber are good targets as is
chemicals/steel/electric power if they are available as targets.  In phase I
and phase II games railyards can be a good target due to its high critical
level.  Do not waste your time bombing targets in many different industries, as
this will not score points in the short run.

Aviation Gas - By reducing aviation gas to below 5 (and keeping it there) you
will be able to ground the Luftwaffe.  Bombing chemicals if available is a good
way to help keep up an aviation gas shortage, so a good time to bomb aviation
gas is just after chemicals is discovered as a target.  Keep in mind that you
may have to wait several weeks to begin seeing the effect and that you will
have to make many deep raids against 1 and 2 point targets to maintain the fuel
shortage, but the results can be well worth the effort.

Escorts - Proper use of your escorting fighters can make or break your grand
strategy.  Remember to send out your fighters on deep escort from 30-50 minutes
later than the bombers so that they don't waste fuel while waiting for the slow
climbing bombers to form up and send them out at 1-3000 feet above the bombers
(by staggering the elevation of your escorts the high groups will be able to
bounce German fighters that are attacking your low groups).  Also don't forget
to send fighters out to cover the bombers on their return trip, otherwise the
Luftwaffe will devastate your home-bound bombers.  Let's assume you have the
following fighters available to cover a raid on Berlin which will form up at
600 at 22000 feet: 10 x P47D, 8 x P51D, 3 x P38J.

A matching escort schedule could look like this:
630 - 6 P47 23000 feet
640 - 3 P51 24000 feet
700 - 3 P38 25000 feet
710 - 2 P51 25000 feet
800 - 3 P51 23000 feet
920 - 4 P47 24000 feet

This plan provides escort cover all the way to Berlin and back.  This is just a
suggested allocation of escorts and it is left to you to discover the optimum
escort tactics.

Luftwaffe Player
----------------
Flak - You should attempt to concentrate flak in those cities you expect to be
bombed.  For example if you see that the American player is attempting to
destroy your rubber plants, place 195 heavy batteries in each of the major
rubber targets as soon as possible.  Also, protect those industries that are
especially important in your defense (i.e. aviation gas, aircraft factories,
chemicals).  Never place 200 batteries in a city for you will lose any
batteries that the cities armament factories produce.  Placing flak is purely
a matter of anticipating the USAAF palyer's intentions.

Aircraft - Keep your single engine fighters based on airfields in France,
Northwest Germany and Italy and base your rocket firing bomber-destoryers in
central and southern Germany.  It is wise to concentrate a large number of
airfields and air gruppes around Essen.  Use your high manueverability fighters
(greater than 35) to bounce enemy fighters especially P-38 and P-51 long-range
fighters.  If you are successful at forcing these fighters to turn back, you
can unleash your bomber-destroyers to attack deep raids into Germany.  The
ME410, ME110 and JU88 should be equipped with rockets and launched last but
be forewarned that if they are attacked by American fighters they will be
decimated.  Do not fly units with less than 20-25 serviceable planes and pull
units back to the safety of central German airfields if their morale is reduced
below 40.  Try to keep your best units poised on the front line airfields but
realize that you will lose morale each time you shuttle an air gruppe from one
field to another.

Patrols - Patrols are useful in two ways.  First they can be used to mass a
large number of aircraft in one spot.  This will allow you to launch a
coordinated attack that may be able to overwhelm the escorts.  Patrols can also
be used to shield the French coast against USAAF fighter raids on German
airfields.

Aircraft Production - This is your chance to build the Luftwaffe to suit your
own style of warfare.  It's usually a good idea early in the game to convert
some or all of your ME109G factories to the production of FW190A fighters.
Although this will result in lower production, you will generally find that
you have all of the ME109G's you would ever want especially when you begin to
convert whole gruppes to the new plane types.  If you believe that the USAAF
player is going to concentrate on destroying your aviation gas (and most do),
it's a very good idea to convert some of your factories to ME262A production in
order to speed up the arrival of your jets (remember that jets do not require
aviation gas to fly).  If the USAAF player does not bomb your aircraft
factories, you will find that you have plenty of production capacity that can
be spared on jet production.  If however, the USAAF player concentrates on
your aircraft factories, and he catches you converting all of your factories
to new production, you may find yourself facing a critical shortage of
aircraft.
