Note 1: Character must be erect to enter. Loses movement
        capability for next segment.

Note 2: Character loses movement capability for the following
        segment.

A) Character altitude

   Normally a character is considered to be at the altitude equal
to the height of his head. Each body part is assigned an altitude
according to posture and terrain.

B) Line of Sight

   Six Gun Shootout uses a line of sight to ensure you see only
what your character could see. Walls, etc. block your vision
making other characters seem invisible to your sight. Use V to
see your line of sight.

WEAPONS:

   Characters may carry a maximum of 3 weapons. Only a weapon in
hand may be loaded, fired or used in combat. Some weapons must be
cocked or loaded often, thus making them un-ready after a
segment.

COMBAT:

A) Procedure

   When it is a character's turn, and his weapon speed is fast
enough to allow him to fire during the segment, he may fire at an
opposing character. The target must be in range of the firing
weapon. After hitting 'F' for fire, the targeting cursor appears
on the firing character. Move the cursor by hitting the number of
the direction you wish by choosing from the direction table in
the lower right side of the screen. The cursor will cause a
status report for each character it moves over. When the
appropriate target is selected, hit <RET> then a '9' when it asks
for target again, to fire. 'X' will exit to cammand level again.
If an unloaded weapon is fired, the segment is lost and the
message CLICK is displayed. Hand to Hand combat works much the
same way, but the characters must be adjacent.

B) Hit Locations

   Hit locations are determined mainly by the computer, though it
sometimes allows sharpshooting.

C) Wounds

   Wounds can cause knockdowns, incapacitation, and death. A
character who has any part of the body reduced to 0 HP is knocked
prone. If the head or chest is reduced to 0 HP then the character
is dead and removed from the game. When a character has his gut
and any other part of the body reduced to 0 HP he is dead. When a
character has any combination of two of legs or arms at 0 HP then
the character is incapacitated and removed from the game.

D) Winning

   The winner is the player with the most points at the end of
the scenario. Killing all the opposition does not insure victory.
