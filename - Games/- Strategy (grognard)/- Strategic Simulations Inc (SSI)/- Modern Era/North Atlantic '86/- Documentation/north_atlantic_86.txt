NORTH ATLANTIC '86 MANUAL
=========================

1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
   NORTH ATLANTIC 86 is an operational level game, featuring combat between
Soviet and NATO air, land, surface-naval and submarine forces for control of the
North Atlantic.  Every ship, airplane, or infantry company available to the
local Soviet and NATO commanders is now under your control.  You will need to
organize your ships into task forces to perform various missions: sea lane
interdiction, land bombardment, supply/troop transport, evacuation, etc.  All
play revolves around the creation and manipulation of these task forces and the
effective concentration of air power.  Included are campaign games covering
September 7 to December 31, 1986 and November 1 to December 31, 1986, minigames
covering the invasion of Iceland in November 1986, and a North Atlantic convoy
operation in September 1986.

1.1 Description of Action
-------------------------
   Each game turn represents the passage of 12 hours.  A game turn consists of:
(1) building and adjusting friendly task forces; (2) moving your task forces;
(3) launching air missions; (4) launching missile attacks; (5) combat
resolution.

1.2 Talking to the Computer
---------------------------
   To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers (such as ship or
task force identification numbers or the number of aircraft performing a
mission), type the number into the computer and press the (RETURN) key.  To
select a routine from the Task Force Menu or answer a Yes/No question, just
press the desired key.  If you wish to halt the game during the combat
resolution phase, type CNTRL-C.  This will cause the program to pause until you
press another key.

1.3 Saving a Game
-----------------
   Upon completion of the combat phase of each turn, the computer will allow the
player(s) to save the game in progress.  You will need a scratch disk to store
the saved game data.  The disk must be initalized for SSI use, before starting
the game by following the instructions included in the game program.  Once the
game is saved, you will be able to restart it from point at which you left off.

1.4 The Map
-----------
   The map is a 40 x 40 square grid representation of the North Atlantic
Theatre.  Each square measures 100km in width.  Green squares are land; blue
squares are ocean; white squares are bases; red squares are Soviet TFs; and
black squares are NATO TFs.  The range between squares is calculated between
the center of the first square and the center of the second square.  The number
thus obtained is rounded up.

Example:

     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |X |  |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |  |  |  |X |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

  5 squares over and 1 square up equals range of 5.099, or 6.

4.0 TASK FORCE ADJUSTMENT
=========================
   At the start of the task force adjustment phase, the computer will display a
menu listing four options for adjusting your forces and seven options for
reviewing the status of your forces.  To enter the desired routine, just press
the corresponding numbered or letterd key.

4.1 Forming Task Forces
-----------------------
A. Enter the code for the port in which you will assemble your TF (A, M, R).
B. Enter the code for the mission your TF will perform.  See Section 9.2 for
   list of the possible missions.
C. The computer will list those ships in the selected port that are eligible
   ship perform the selected mission.  Each ship will be displayed with its
   ship number.
D. Assemble your TF by entering the desired ship numbers.  In some cases, the
   screen cannot list all of the eligible ships at once; if you do not see the
   ships that you want, press (RETURN) and another batch of ships can be
   listed.
E. When the computer prompts CONTINUE SELECTION Y/N, press (Y) if you are
   satisfied with your selection, or press (N), and the computer will run
   through the list again.

4.2 Combining TFs
-----------------
   Two TFs occupying the same grid location may be combined in the following
manner:
A. Enter the number of the "gaining TF" and the "merging TF".
B. All ships in the "merging TF" will be added to the "gaining TF" and the
   "merging TF" will be deleted.
C. If the "merging TF" had a lower endurance than the "gaining TF", then the
   "gaining TF" will assume the lower endurance.
D. Submarine TFs may not combine with non-submarine TFs.
E. Aircraft carriers may not combine with non-combat patrol (C) TFs.
F> Transports may not combine with non-transport (T) TFs.

4.3 Divding TFs
---------------
A. Enter the number of the TF you wish to divide.  The computer will list the
   ships in the selected TF.
B. The Soviet player is allowed 9 active TFs, the NATO player is allowed 11.
   If you are currently using the maximum number of TFs, then the computer will
   display the message TOO MANY ACTIVE TFs and return to the menu.
C. Enter the number of the ships you wish to transfer to a new TF.  The
   computer will set up a new TF for you.  The new TF will have the same
   mission and endurance as the original TF.
D. If you are currently using fewer than your maximum number of TFs, then the
   DIVIDE TF function may be used to "scuttle" crippled ships.  Just enter the
   letter (S) following the number of the ship you are transferring.  Your
   opponent will receive one less victory point for ships that are scuttled
   than would ordinarily be awarded for a ship sunk involuntarily.  (Your crew
   is assumed to have been removed safely).

4.4 Loading Transports
----------------------
   Troops and supplies may be loaded onto ships which are located in a friendly
port (America, Murmansk, Riga).

A. Use the LOAD TRANSPORTS routine, enter the code for the port in which the
   loading is to take place.  The computer will list all eligible ships in that
   port with a cargo capacity greater than zero.
B. Enter the number of the ship you wish to load and then enter the number of
   infantry companies and/or supply units you wish to load.  Each infantry
   company represents 100 men.
C. If you wish to unload cargo while still in port, type a (U) in response to
   the question NUMBER OF INFANTRY COMPANIES/SUPPLY UNITS TO BE LOADED ? By
   typing a (U), the current cargo will be unloaded.
D. Only supply units may be loaded into ships whose prefix begins with the
   letter A (AP, AK, AE etc).

4.5 Checking the Pipeline
-------------------------
   Reinforcements and repaired ships will periodically be sent to ports you
control.  To check the status of these ships, you may wish to request the
current condition of your ship "pipeline".

A. Enter the code (A, M, R) for the port you wish to check.
B. Enter the Ship Type Prefix: Press (RETURN) if you wish to view all ships in
   the piepline.  To view a particular type of ship, enter the first letter of
   the ship abbreviation.  EXAMPLE Enter "D" to list only DD and DDG type ships
   in the pipeline.
C. Enter Maximum Delay Time: Press (RETURN) to view all ships in the pipeline.
   Enter a number (N) if you do not wish to view any ships that will exceed N
   days in the pipeline.
D. The computer will list all ships currently in that port and all ships due to
   arrive there.
E. For ships in the repair, refit or reinforcement "pipeline", the computer
   will list the time in days before that ship can return or arrive.

4.6 Sunk Ships Display
----------------------
   The computer will list all ships that have been sunk and the points awarded
for their sinking.  During the Campaign scenarios, the computer will not list
sunk cargo and amphibious ships.

4.7 Air Group Display

   The computer will display the number of each type of aircraft assigned to
each friendly airbase or carrier that is active.

4.8 List Active TFs
-------------------
A. The computer lists the TF number, mission, and endurance for each friendly
   TF currently active.
B. If you wish to examine the ships in a particular TF, enter the number of the
   TF you wish to examine.  If you do not wish to examine a TF just press
   (RETURN).

4.9 Map Display
---------------
   The computer will display the map and all friendly active TFs.  If you wish
to locate a particular friendly TF on the map, enter that TFs number.  The TFs
square will flash to indicate its location.

  14. Sonar Strength: the qualitative rating assigned for a ship's sonar
                      equipment.


5.0 TASK FORCE MOVEMENT
=======================
   TFs move by expending movement points.  The number of movement points a TF
is allowed is dependent on the TFs "fleet speed".

5.1 Fleet Speed
---------------
A. A TFs fleet speed is calculated as 30 knots or the speed of the slowest ship
   in the TF, whichever is lower.

5.2 Movement
------------
A. A TF receives one movement point for each 2-1/2 knots of fleet speed.  A TF
   will receive a minimum of three movement points.
B. A TF expends two movement points for each square moved in directions N,S,E,
   W.
C. A TF expends three movement points for each square moved in directionns NW,
   NE, SW, SE.
D. A TF with fewer than two points remaining in its move may not move any
   further, but it may still "dock".
E. If you accidently press the wrong key while moving, you may press the (A)
   abort key and start your move over.  This may not be done after you have
   docked a TF or pressed (0) to end the move.
F. A TF may never enter a land square, TFs may move freely through any other
   square.

5.3 Entering Harbor - Unloading Ships
-------------------------------------
A. A TF that begins move on a friendly base square may enter the harbor and
   unload cargo by pressing (9) for "dock".  For a TF that begins its move in
   a harbor and wishes to remain in the harbor, press (9) to dock.  For a TF
   that wishes to exit a harbor but remain in the same square, press (0).
B. Each ship may unload a maximum of 18 infantry companies or 3 supply units
   or an equivalent combination of infantry and supply.
C. While "in harbor" a TF may never be attacked by enemy ships, submarines or
   missiles.
D. While "in harbor" a TFs ships are more vulnerable to bombing attack; bomber
   accuracy is doubled when attacking ships "in harbor".
E. To unload troops and supplies on an enemy-controlled base (amphibious
   assault), follow the procedure listed in A, above Ships will unload infantry
   /supplies at a rate of 9/2 instead of 18/3.  When unloading at an enemy-
   controlled base, ships will never enter the harbor.

5.4 Movement Sequence
---------------------
A. During the movement phase, TFs must be moved sequentially according to TF
   number.  Once a TF has completed its move, the action cannot be reversed.
B. A player may examine the ships in a TF at any time during the TFs movement
   segment.  Press the (S) ships key, and the computer will give a complete
   status display for each ship in the TF.  The column heads for the display
   are explained in section 2.3.
C. To change a TFs EW(Electronic Warfare) mode, press (M).  A TFs EW mode may
   be either Passive or Active.  TFs in Passive Mode have all Radars and Active
   Sonars turned off.  TFs in Active Mode will automatically reveal their
   position to enemy searches.  TFs in active mode will have an increased
   chance to destroy or jam enemy anti-ship missiles.  Submarines in active
   mode will have an increased chance to acquire torpedo targets.  Active EW-
   mode is indicated when the words "EW-MODE" are displayed in inverse print.


6.0 PLANNING LAND ATTACKS
=========================
   On any turn in which both Soviet and NATO forces occupy either Faroes or
Iceland, the computer will request an attack level for both players.  The
attack levels range from 0 to 5, with 0 being no attack, 1 being a very low
intensity attack... 5 being a very high intensity attack.  The supplies
consumed by a particular attack will be equal to the attack level.


7.0 AIR OPERATIONS
==================
   During the Air Operation Phase, a player may (1) launch CAP ; (2) observe
search results; (3) launch air stikes; (4) transfer aircraft (5) launch SSM/ASW
attacks.

7.1 CAP Missions
----------------
A. At the start of the Air Operation Phase, each player must determine how
many of his fighters will fly CAP missions.  Aircrafts performing CAP may not
participate in air strikes or transfers during that turn.

B. Fighters may fly two types of CAP missions: (1) normal CAP, and (2) long-
range CAP.  Normal CAP will protect only the TF or airbase from which it
originated. Long-range CAP will protect any friendly TF within range of the CAP
aircraft. For CAP purposes, the range equals half the aircraft's strike range.
Only a fraction of an airgroup performing long-range CAP will intercept an
enemy bomber or missile strike.  (The greater the distance between the CAP's
home base and the strike target, the smaller the fraction).  The number of CAP
aircraft eligible to intercept a strike may be further reduced if the strike
bombers are armed with long-range landoff missiles.

C. CAP fighters have two methods of engaging enemy airstrikes: (1) Long-Range
   Air-to-Air Missile Combat, (2) Dogfight Combat.  Both Missile and dogfight
   combat will occur when CAP intercepts airstrikes armed with regular bombs
   (standoff range=0).  There is a chance that CAP aircraft will fail to engage
   enemy air strikes armed with Long-Range Stand-Off Missiles.  The probability
   of failure is affected by: (1) stand-off range, (2) CAP air-to-air missile
   range, (3) range of CAP aircraft, (4) the success of Early Warning Aircraft
   in detecting the strike.  It is possible that CAP will proceed in firing
   missiles at an airstrike, but fail to engage it in dogfight combat.

D. Listed below are the AVERAGE/MAXIMUM interception ranges (in km), each type
   of fighter aircraft:

                          Long Range CAP
                       Missile       Missile      Dogfight    Dogfight

   + EW = Successful Early Warning
   EW   = Unsuccessful Early Warning
   NM   = Aircraft does not carry long-range missile

7.2 Search Missions
-------------------
A. Searches are performed automatically each turn by utility aircraft based on
   ships, carriers, or land bases.  These aircraft will be listed on the Weapons
   display.  The SURFACE/SUBMARINE search ranges for each type of aircraft are
   listed below:

        HELICOPTER   4/3           RECONNASSANCE    20/0
        ASW          0/6           EARLY WARNING     8/0

B. The success of a seach attempt is affected by the number of aircraft
   searching and the distance to the enemy TF/submarine, and the number of
   ships in the enemy TF.

C. The different types of utility aircraft will search separtately.

D. Submarines may obtain SONAR CONTACTS on enemy TFs within their Patrol Area.


7.3 Search Display
------------------
A. The results of all friendly searches may be viewed on the search display.
B. The number for each located enemy TF or submarine will be listed and the
   location square on the map will be lit with the appropriate color.
C. To check the location and view the contents of an enemy force, enter the TF
   number for that force.  The computer will list the types of ships sighted
   and flash the location on the map.  The list of sighted ships may not be
   entirely accurate.
D. The computer will not list the contents of a submarine force or a surface TF
   located only due to its ACTIVE EW mode.
E. A TF with an asterisk by its number was located in a harbor.


7.4 Launching Air Strikes
-------------------------
   Enemy bases and enemy surface TFs sighted on the Search Display may be
attacked by available friendly aircraft within range.

A. The computer will request a target for each friendly active airbase/carrier.
   Type in the I.D. number of the enemy TF/base you wish to attack.  The
   computer will list the range to the target and ask you how many of each type
   of aircraft you want to launch.  The computer will not allow you to attack
   unsighted/detected enemy TFs.  Each player may launch a total of ten air
   strikes per turn.  A particular carrier/base may launch more than one air
   strike in a turn.
B. The following bases may be attacked by typing in the target numbers listed
   below or the first two letters of the base's name.

         MURMANSK     1         ICELAND (SV)       6
         RIGA         2         SCAPA FLOW        17
         HAMBURG      3         FAROES (NATO)     18
         BERGEN       4         ICELAND (NATO)    19
         FAROES (SV)  5

C. For planning air strikes against enemy ships the computer will ask you to
   enter a stand-off range.  If you enter a range greater than zero, then each
   fighter included in the strike will automatically carry air-to-air missiles
   and each bomber in the strike will automatically carry an air-to-surface
   missile.  If you enter a range of zero, then for each type of fighter
   included in the air strike, you may substitute bombs for the air-to-air
   missiles.  Bombers will automatically carry bombs when the stand-off range
   is zero.  Aircraft may not be included in a strike if the stand-off range
   is greater than the range of the aircraft's AAM or ASM.
D. When planning strikes against land targets, the computer will not allow you
   to enter a stand-off range.  If fighters are included in strikes against
   land targets, the computer will ask if the fighters should carry bombs or
   air-to-air missiles.  For each type of aircraft carrying bombs, the computer
   will ask BASE ATTACK ON GROUND SUPPORT B/G.  Ground support may be desirable
   if opposing forces are present on Iceland or Faroes.
E. Listed below are the various aircraft types, including their range, weapon
   system and weapon system range:

AIRCRAFT           AIRCRAFT RANGE   WEAPON SYSTEM     SYSTEM RANGE

Tornado      -ADV     12000           AMRAAM            150*

* 100 added to range of long range AAMs to aid in calculating interception
range.

7.5 Aircraft Transfers
----------------------
   Aircraft transfers may be performed between airbases and/or carriers with
the following restrictions:

A. Only four air missions may be performed each turn.
B. Transport aircraft (Starlifter, Cub) may only be included in transfer mission
   during the first two missions performed during AM turns only.
C. For transfer purposes, aircraft have their range tripled.

7.6 Air Transport Operations
----------------------------
   Troops or supplies may be transferred between airbases, using transport
aircraft (Starlifter, Cub).

A. Whenever a transport aircraft is included in an air transfer mission (see
   7.5), the computer will ask TRANSPORT TROOPS OR SUPPLIES T/S.  Press (T) to
   transport infantry; press (S) to transport supplies; press (RETURN) if you
   do not wish to transport any cargo.
B. Each transport may carry one company (100 men) of infantry.  The number of
   supply units transferred in equal to the number of transport aircraft
   divided by the transfer range.

7.7 Airborne Assault
--------------------
   An airborne assault will occur whenever transport aircraft are included in
an air strike against an enemy base on Iceland or Faroes.

A. Only one airborne assault strike may be flown per turn.
B. Each transport aircraft included in the mission will attempt to airdrop one
   infantry company on the target island.  If a transport is destroyed by CAP
   or AA-fire, an infantry company is also destroyed.
C. The airdropped infantry force will automatically be included in a level-5
   attack against the enemy infantry on the island on the same turn they are
   dropped.

7.8 Launching SSM and ASW Attacks
---------------------------------
A. Tfs may use SSMs or ASWs to attack enemy TFs/subs detected during the search
   phase.  TFs in a harbor may not fire SSMs or ASWs nor may they be fired upon
   by SSMs or ASWs.
B. If you select an enemy surface TF for a target, the computer will allow you
   to fire any of your ship's SSMs, if they are within range.  The range of an
   SSM in squares is equal to its range in km divided by 100, fractions rounded
   up.  The number of SSMs that may be fired in one turn by a particular ship/
   sub may not exceed the maximum salvo number for that ship/sub.
C. Range permitting, each ship in attacking TF which has no SSMs will
   automatically fire one of its SAMs at the target TF.  This will only occur
   if the attacking TF is in Active-EW mode.
D. If you select an enemy submarine for a target, your ships may fire their ASW
   systems at the target.  Each ship in the attacking TF will have a 50% chance
   of firing its ASW.  A maximum of three ASWs of any one type may be fired per
   turn.  The range of ASWs is equal to two spaces.
E. When conducting as SSM or an ASW attack, each submarine in a TF will have
   only a 33% chance if firing its missiles.
F. When selecting a target, if you are unsure of the enemy TF numbers or
   locations, type (S) for the target number, and the computer will display the
   numbers of the sighted enemy TFs and allow you to locate them on the map.


8.0 COMBAT RESOLUTION
=====================
   During the combat resolution phase, the computer will automatically perform
the following functions:

(1) Air Strike Resolution
(2) Missile (SSM, ASM, ASW) Resolution
(3) Surface and Submarine Combat Resolution
(4) Return Aircraft to their Bases/carriers
(5) Resolve Land Combat
(6) Repair and Refit of ships
(7) Activate Reinforcements

8.1 Air Strike Resolution
-------------------------
   Each air strike is resolved in the following sequence:

(1) Air Early-Warning resolution
(2) Long-range AAM combat
(3) Dogfight combat
(4) Ships fire Long range SAMs
(5) Bombers launch ASMs
(6) Flak resolution
(7) Bombers drop bombs

   For stand-off missile strikes, segments 6 and 7 are omitted.

A. Early Warning aircraft may detect incoming air strikes and missile strikes
   against targets up to 8 spaces (800 km) away from their bases.  Successful
   detection is affected by the number of early warning aircraft available, the
   distance from the base to the target, and the stand-off range of the
   airstrike.
B. Long range AAM combat may occur if CAP or strike aircraft are equipped with
   Phoenix, AMRAAM or Apex missiles.  The number of missiles each aircraft may
   fire is dependent on the type of missile as follows:

               Phoenix       3
               AMRAAM        2
               Apex          1

   AAMs fired by strike aircraft may acquire targets from any of the air groups
performing Normal or Long-range CAP.  AAMs fired by CAP aircraft may acquire
targets from the Strike Group only.  The success of each AAM fired is reduced
by the ECM rating of the target aircraft and the ASW number of the target
aircraft's base/carrier.  Following each AAM combat.  50% of the firing
aircraft in each participating CAP group will suffer missile depletion and be
unable to fire at incoming air strikes occuring per that turn.
   Fighter aircraft must be able to "lock-on" to their targets in order to fire
their long-range AAMs.  The chance of a successful lock-on is determined by the
firing aircraft's RADAR strength.  The chance of firing an enemy plane with a
missile is affected by the ECM rating of the target aircraft:

    TORNADO         3         INTRUDER       4           BACKFIRE     3
    FALCON          1         HARRIER        1           BADGER       1
    TOMCAT          3         FORGER         0           CUB          0
    EAGLE           3         FLOGGER        1           STARLIFTER   0
    CORSAIR         1         FENCER         1

   The higher the ECM rating the lower the chance of being hit to Long range
AAMs.
C. Dogfight combat may occur between CAP fighters and Strike aircraft.
   Individual CAP fighters will randomly select a bomber or escort target and
   attack it.  If the attack fails to shoot down the target aircraft, the
   target aircraft will counterattack.  This sequence is repeated for each
   intercepting CAP fighter.  On PM turns an aircraft must "locate" its target
   in order to attack or counterattack in a dogfight.  The chance of location
   a target is determined by the aircraft's RADAR strength.

   Aircraft are assigned dogfight ratings as follows:

        TORNADO     4         INTRUDER     1          BACKFIRE       1
        FALCON      5         HARRIER      3          BADGER         1
        TOMCAT      4         FORGER       2          CUB            1
        EAGLE       5         FLOGGER      4          STARLIFTER     1
        CORSAIR     2         FENCER       2

   For target selection purposes, the higher the dogfight rating, the greater
the chance that the aircraft will be engaged.  For combat purposes, aircraft
carrying AAMs have their dogfight rating doubled.  If the AAM is a SIDEWINDER,
two additional points are added to the dogfight rating.  If the AAM is an
APHID, one additional point is added.

D. Ships in the target TF may fire SAMs at the strike aircraft if the stand-off
   range of the strike is less than or equal to the range of the SAM.  If early
   warning aircraft failed to detect the strike and the target TF is in PASSIVE
   EW mode, the SAMs will not fire.  The number of SAMs a ship may fire is
   dependent on the type of SAM:

        STANDARD     4         SA-N-1       1         SA-N-6      3
        SEADART      2         SA-N-3       2         SA-N-7      4
        SEASLUG      1

    . The Aegis Cruisers, CG-Ticonderoga and CG-Yorktown, may fire 8 standard
   missiles at an air strike or missile strike.  The target selection and
   missile resolution are the same as for AAM combat.  Each time a ship fires
   SAMs, there is a chance it may exhaust its SAM supply.  The supply of SAMs
   may only be replenished during refit time.  The probability of SAM supply
   exhaustion, increases with the number of SAMs fired.  There is a 50% chance
   that a particular ship will be unable to fire its SAMs at an air strike.
E. Bombers that survive CAP and SAM combat may release their ASMs.  If stand-
   off range equals zero, strike aircraft will be attacked by flak before
   dropping their bombs.  Surviving bombers will select a target ship from those
   in the target TF and attempt to penetrate the flak and deliver their
   ordnance.  Target selection is accomplished in the following manner: Each
   ship is assigned a selection value (SV) equal to its defense factor plus
   Five times its cargo/aircraft capacity; the chance of a particular ship
   being attacked is equal to the SV of that ship divided by the combined SV of
   the target TF.
F. The chance of a bomber being shot down by flak is equal to the TF flak
   strength plus the target's missile defense strength, divided by 500.  The TF
   flak strength is equal to the combined AA (light gun) ratings of all ships
   in the TF.  If there are more than 12 ships in the TF, the TF flak strength
   is equal to the average AA rating of the ships in the TF, multiplied by 12.
G. The chance of a bomb hitting the target is affected by: (1) bomber accuracy,
   (2) maximum speed of target, (3) flak intensity, (4) range of the strike (5)
   size of the target, (6) the "radar" capability of the bomber (on  M turns).
   The relative bomber accuracy/radar capabilities of the varous aircraft are
   listed below:

      TORNADO      14/9       CORSAIR    7/5            FLOGGER    1/4
      FALCON        6/4       INTRUDER  10/8            FENCER     9/7
      TOMCAT       10/8       HARRIER    6/2            BACKFIRE   5/5
      EAGLE        10/6       FORGER     3/1            BADGER     3/3


8.2 Missile Resolution
----------------------
   During the missile resolution phase, all anti-ship and anti-sub missiles
will attempt to destroy their targets.

A. Prior to attacking a ship, the anti-ship missiles may be engaged by CAP-
   firing AAMs, ship firing SAMs, light guns and the target ship's missile
   defense systems.  SAMs will not be fired at surface skimming missiles.  SAMs
   may not fire if early warning aircraft failed to detect the incoming missile
   and the target TF is in PASSIVE-EW mode.  There is a possibility that a TF
   may switch from PASSIVE to ACTIVE EW Mode during the missile Resolution
   phase.  One point is added to the TF flak-strength for each aircraft flying
   Normal CAP over the target TF; otherwise, flak strengths are computed the
   same as for bomber defense.  Note: The further the stand-off range from
   which a missile is fired, the greater the likelihood the missile will
   totally miss the targeted TF.
B. Missiles that survive AAM and SAM fire will break into groups of from 1 to
   7 missiles.  Each group will select and engage a particular target.  As flak
   fires at the missile group, the second missile will be twice as hard to
   destroy as the first; the third will be three times as hard to destroy as
   the first, etc.
C. Missiles that survive all defensive fire may still be jammed by the target
   ship.  The success of jamming is affected by the missile's accuracy rating
   and the EW rating of the target ship.  Missiles with accuracy less than
   five, attacking ships with EW greater than three, will be fairly easy to
   jam.
D. If all else fails, the missile may still miss the target.  The hit or miss
   frequency depends on the missile's accuracy rating.  Accuracy ratings for
   anti-ship missiles are listed below:

       HARPOON     9*      SS-N-7        7*           SS-N-12       6
       TOMAHAWK    9*      SS-N-2c       5            SS-N-19       7
       EXOCET      9*      SS-N-3        4            AS-6          5*
       WALLEYE     7       SS-N-22       7            AS-7          7

       * indicates surface skimming.

D. The probability of anti-submarine missiles hitting their targets is affected
   by: (1) submarine speed, (2) submarine EW rating, (3) missile accuracy.  The
   accuracy ratings of the various ASW missiles are listed below:

       ASROC     4       FRAS-1     4          SUBROC      4
       SS-N-16   4       IKARA      3          SS-N-14     3


8.3 Surface Combat
------------------
   Surface combat may occur between opposing TFs that occupy the same space if
at least one of the TFs is performing a combat patrol mission (C) and has an
endurance of at least 9.

A. Surface combat is resolved using the following sequence:
    (1) each Soviet ship in a TF performing a "C" mission will fire at one of
        the ships from one of the NATO TFs in the same space.
    (2) each NATO ship that occupies the same space as the attacking Soviet,
        TF will fire at one of the ships from the attacking TF.
    (3) each NATO ship in a TF performing a "C" mission will fire at one of the
        ships from one of the Soviet TFs in the same space.
    (4) each Soviet ship that occupies the same space as the attacking NATO TF
        will fire at one of the ships from the attacking TF.
B. Target selection for surface combat is similar to that used for air attacks.
   In surface combat, a ship's selection value is equal to that ship's defense
   factor.
C. When attacking each ship will: (1) fire torpedoes, (2) fire main guns, (3)
   fire light guns.  Only Soviet ships armed with the 533MM torpedo may fire
   torpedoes during surface combat.  The accuracy of torpedoes and gunfire is
   adjusted by the speed and size of the target.


8.4 Submarine Combat
--------------------
A. Submarines patrol an area up to two spaces away from their artus TF
   location.
B. Each sub in a TF will have a chance to engage an enemy TF within its patrol
   area.  The probability of engagement is affected by the sub's speed, sonar
   strength, and EW mode.  Subs that have been detected by enemy search have
   their probability of engagement reduced by 2/3.  The probability of engaging
   an enemy sub will be 1/4 that of engaging an enemy surface TF.
C. The chance of engaging and torpedoing an enemy ship will be reduced by the
   number of ASW ships (sonar strength greater than zero) present in the
   defending TF.
D. When attacking submarines fire two torpedoes at their target.  After each
   attack, there is a ten precent chance that the sub's torpedo supply will be
   exhaused.  The sub must undergo refit in port to regain its torpedo
   capability.
E. After a submarine attack, the ASW ships in the target TF will attempt to
   track and attack the sub.  The ASW ships may fire either ASW or AST systems
   at the sub.  The probability of getting a shot at the sub is affected by sub
   speed.  ASW ship speed, sub EW strength, ASW ship's sonar strength, and ASW/
   AST system's range.  The probability of sinking the sub is affected by ASW/
   AST system's accuracy.
F. The Range/Accuracy of the ASW and AST systems is listed below:
       ASROC      20/4          MK48 TORPEDO         50/5
       SUBROC     55/4          TIGERFISH TORPEDO    40/4
       IKARA      20/3          533MM TORPEDO        20/3
       FRAS-1     25/4          400MM TORPEDO         7/4
       SS-N-14    50/3          MK46 TORPEDO         10/4
       SS-N-16    75/4


8.5 Aircraft Returning to Base
------------------------------
A. After completing their missions, aircraft will attempt to return to the same
   base or carrier from which they were launched.
B. If launched from a carrier which received 26% or more damage or had its
   speed reduced below 15 knots, the aircraft will try to make an "emergency"
   landing on another carrier or airbase.
C. Emergency landings will occur automatically if there is a friendly base or
   carrier within 3 squares of the origin carrier.
      CV-Invincible and CV-Ark Royal may only receive Harrier aircraft, CVG-
   Kiev and CVG-Minsk may only receive Forger aircraft.
D. If an emergency landing is required and there are no eligible bases or
   carriers within 3 squares, then the aircraft will ditch in the ocean.
E. Aircraft which engaged in CAP, STRIKE or TRANSFER missions during the turn
   will suffer approximately 1% Non-Combat Losses for each mission.  Troops and
   supplies being Air-Transported will also suffer the 1% loss.


8.6 Land Combat
---------------
   Land combat may occur whenever both Soviet and NATO infantry are present on
Iceland or Faroes.  Land combat must be planned at the end of the previous
movement phase.

A. Land attack procedure is as follows: (1) defender forces open fire conflict-
   ing casualties on the attacker, (2) surviving attacker forces inflict
   casualties on the defender.
B. As a general rule, the greater the attack level (1-5), the greater the
   casualties on both sides.  Attacks made without adequate supplies will
   suffer doubled casualties.  Defensive fire from an unsupplied force will be
   half as effective.
C. The ultimate objective of land combat is to capture or defend the airfield
   and harbor facilities on Iceland or Faroes.  If the Total Combat Strength
   (TCS) of the attacker is greater than the TCS of the defender, the airfield/
   harbor may be captured.  The attacker TCS is computed as (INF COMPANIES +
   GROUND SUPPORT POINTS) x RANDOM NUMBER.  The defender is computed as INF
   COMPANIES + GROUND SUPPORT POINTS.
D. It is possible that an airfield will be suppressed for one turn following an
   defense enemy assult.  The message AIRFIELD UNDER HEAVY FIRE will signal the
   airfield's suppression.  Air operations will not be allowed during the turn
   following the suppression message.


8.7 Ground Support and Bombardment
----------------------------------
   The outcome of land combat may be affected by bombers performing ground
support missions and ships performing bombardment (B) missions.

A. Bombers flying ground support over Iceland or Faroes add ground support
   points to the local land combat strength.  Ships in TFs with "B" mission
   will also add ground support points if the TF occupies the Iceland or Faroes
   squares.
B. Battleship main guns are worth three ground support points each: all light
   guns are worth 1/2 ground support point each.  Cruiser main guns are worth
   one ground support point each.
C. Ground support points have the following effect on land combat: (1) each
   ground support point will suppress, on the average, one company worth of
   enemy defensive/offensive fire, (2) each ground support point will add, on
   the average, 1/2 company worth of friendly offensive/defensive fire.
D. An aircraft's ground support capability is determined by: (1) the aircraft's
   bomb accuracy rating, and (2) the aircraft's radar rating on P.M. turns.
   During a ground support strike, each <*> burst displayed on the screen
   indicates 2 ground support hits (points) have been scored.


8.8 Repair and Refit Ships
--------------------------
A. Damaged ships which docked during the previous movement phase are placed in
   the Repair and Refit Pipelines.  Undamaged ships will be placed in the refit
   pipeline only.  A TF that docks with an endurance greater than 50 will not
   be required to refit.  Refit time is three days.
B. The average number of turns needed for repair is equal to 9 x DAMAGE POINTS
   SUFFERED.  The number of damage points suffered is equal to the ship's
   DEFENSE FACTOR x DAMAGE PERCENTAGE.  Repair time may be doubled for some
   ships with smaller ships having a greater chance of lengthed repair time.
   (There is a 71% chance that an average FF's repair time will be doubled
   while a U.S. Battleship has only a 5% chance of requiring double repair
   time.)


8.9 Reinforcement Arrival
-------------------------
   Ship reinforcements will arrive on a day-to-day basis as scheduled on the
pipeline display.  Infantry, supply, and aircraft reinforcements will be as
follows:

A. Each turn there is a 1/16 chance of arrival for each of the above-listed
   reinforcement options (only during campaign games).
B. The Soviets will be more likely to receive reinforcement option #1 during
   the first two weeks of October and the last week in September.
C. The Soviets will automatically receive reinforcement option #1 following any
   turn in which the combined total of Fencers and Floggers is less than 100.
   When this occurs the NATO player will be awarded 50 points.
D. NATO will automatically receive reinforcement option #3 following any turn
   in which the combined total of Tornados, Eagles and Falcons is less than 50.
   When this occurs the Soviet player will be awarded 25 VPs.
E. Reinforcements will not arrive during the Convoy QR44 or Iceland Scenarios.


9.0 GENERAL OPERATIONS
======================

9.1 Damage to Ships
-------------------
   Ships accrue damage points when they are hit by bombs, torpedoes, missile or
gunfire.  When the total damage points are greater than the equal to a ship's
Defensive Factor (DF), that ship will sink.  When total damage points are
greater than 50% of ship's DF, that ship is crippled.

A. Listed below are the average damage points caused by each type of weapon:
         Light (AA) gun      5            Walleye       12
         CL Main gun         1            SS-N-2C        5
         BB Main gun         7            SS-N-3        12
         Torpedo             8            SS-N-7         9
         Bomb                8            SS-N-12        9
         SAM                 2            SS-N-19        8
         Harpoon             4            AS-6          15
         Tomahawk            7            AS-7           7
         Exocet              7            SS-N-22        6

B. ASW or torpedo hits will always sink a submarine.
C. Torpedo hits will reduce a ship's maximum speed by at least five knots.
D. Whenever a ship is hit, it may suffer additional damage due to critical hit.
   The message EXPLOSION ON BOARD ... reveals that a critical hit has been
   scored.
E. Crippled ships may accrue additional damage while returning to port.  Major
   additional damage will be shown by the message EXPLOSINON ON BORAD.
   Crippled ships are considered to have fires or flooding which has not yet
   been controlled.  It is possible for a crippled ship to repair itself while
   at sea.  Repairs will be attempted until a ship is no longer crippled.
F. Carriers with 26% or more damage or maximum speed less than 15 knots may not
   launch or land aircraft.  Note: this means that carriers in TFs reduced to
   five knots, due to zero endurance, will not be able to launch aircraft.
G. The U.S.N. Carriers with between 26% and 35% damage will attempt repairs
   until damage is reduced below 26%.


9.2 TF Missions
---------------
   Listed below are the missions that may be assigned to a TF and the endurance
allowed for each mission:

              Mission              Endurance
       C - Combat patrol      60 turns (30 days)
       B - Bombardment        60 turns
       T - Transport          60 turns
       E - Evaculation        60 turns
       U - Submarine          90 turns
       R - Return               N/A

A. Carriers may only perform "C" missions.
B. AP,AK,AO,AE,AKR and AFS type ships may only perform "T" missions.
C. LST,LHA,LPH,LPD type ships may only perform "T" or "E" missions.
D. SS,SSN and SSNG type ships may only perform "U" missions.
E. Only TFs with a "C" mission may initiate surface combat.  A TF may not
   initiate surface combat with endurance less than 9.
F. Surface combat may cause a Bombardment (B) TF to abort its mission. (An
   aborted "B" mission would change to "R".)
G. An evacuation (E) TF that docks at a friendly base will automatically load
   infantry into all LST, LPH, LHA and LPD type ships up to their capacity.
   Evacuation TFs that load infantry will have their mission changed to "T"
   and may then unload the troops normally at any harbor or port.


9.3 TF Endurance
----------------
A. TFs endurance is reduced by one for each trun that it spends at sea.
B. TF that ends its move in a harbor will not have endurance reduced.
C. A bombardment TF will have its endurance reduced by 10% for each turn that
   it provides bombardment support.
D. Surface combat reduces endurance as follows: The attacking TFs endurance is
   reduced to 8 (if currently greater than 8), if the defending TFs combined
   defensive factors multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1 is greater
   than 25.  The defending TFs endurance is reduced to 8 (if currently greater
   than 8) if the total attacker defense factors multiplied by random number
   between 0 and 1 is greater than 25.
E. If a TFs endurance reahces zero and it fails to dock during that turn, all
   its non-nuclear powered ships will have their speed reduced to 5 knots.
F. Submarines with zero endurance may not fire torpedoes.


9.4 Supply
----------
   Supply units are used for (1) infantry daily supply, (2) land combat, (3)
forming TFs (4) performing air missions.

A. Bases must spend daily supplies to maintain their troops.  The daily apply
   cost for each base is equal to the number of occupying infantry comapnies
   divided by 100, fractions rounded up.  EXAMPLE: An infantry Ace of 225
   companies must have three supply units for daily supply (225/100 = 2.25
   rounded up to 3).  Bases that have supply levels inadequate to meet daily
   supply requirements will lose 1% of their infantry strength per day,
   fractions rounded up.  America, Murmansk, and Riga are exempted from daily
   supply requirements.
B. Supplies are consumed in land combat.  Attacking forces will consume the
   supply dump for each level of attack, while defender forces will consume
   one supply dump, regardless of the attack level. (See section 6B for effects
   of inadequate supply on combat.)
C. The major ports (America, Murmansk, and Riga) must use supplies to form
   ships into TFs.  The cost of placing a ship in a TF is equal to 1/5 of that
   ship's DF (fractions rounded down).
D. A TF that returns to port with an endurance greater than 30 will return a
   unused fuel to the port.  The quantity of fuel (supply) returned is equal to
   each ship's DF divided by 10 (fractions rounded down).
E. Airbases consume one supply point for each air strike launched.  CAP, search
   and transfer missions do not consume supply points.  If a base's supply
   level falls below three.  CAP and search missions may not be flown.


8.5 Scoring
-----------
A. Players receive victory points (VPs) for sinking enemy ships equal to the
   ship's defense factor plus its cargo/aircraft capacity.  Players receive one
   VP for each damage point inflicted on an enemy ship at sea at the end of the
   game.  Players also receive one VP for each week a ship is out of operation
   at the end of the game (less three days for normal refits).  A ship that
   scuttled is worth one less victory point than one that sinks on its own.
B. The NATO player receives ten VPs for each NATO Morale point remaining at the
   end of a Campaign Scenario. (See section 9.8).  The NATO Player receives 4
   VPs for each supply point in Scapa Flow at the end of the convoy QR.44
   scenario.  The NATO player begins the Convoy scenario with 100 victory
   points.
C. Either player may score 500 VPs wach for possession of Iceland or Faroes.
   Control of the airfield and harbor facilities is required for the possession.
   In the Convoy scenario the Soviet player is not awarded points on Iceland
   and the Faroes.
D. The Soviet Player scores 1000 points if NATO Morale is zero at the end of
   the game. (See section 9.8).
E. The current score is summarized at the beginning of each turn.
F. Subtract Soviet VPs from NATO VPs and compare the results to the following
   table to determine the victory level:

           1000 and up         NATO Decisive Victory
           500 to 999          NATO Substantive Victory
           100 to 499          NATO Marginal Victory
           -99 to 99           Draw
           -499 to -100        Soviet Marginal Victory
           -999 to -500        Soviet Substantive Victory
           -1000 and less      Soviet Decisive Victory


9.6 Weather
-----------
   There are four levels of weather: clear, light, overcast, heavy overcast
and storm.

A. There is a random chance each turn that the weather will change.  The
   weather is graduated such that in any one turn, the weather should not
   change from clear to heavy overcast; it would have to change to light
   overcast before it could become heavy overcast.  There is a random chance
   that heavy overcast will become a storm instead.  Storms will be rare in
   September and October and more frequent in November and December.
B. Weather will influence the ability to spot enemy TFs at range greater than
   1.5.  The chance of spotting TFs at ranges over 1.5 will be reduced 1/3
   during light overcast and 2/3 during heavy overcast.  Storms will prevent
   all air operations, including missile attacks.
C. During storm, turns all surface TFs will have their speed restrict to 5
   knots.
D. The light blue area at the top of the map is the Iceberg Zone.  Surface TFs
   must stop upon entering an iceberg square.  Submarines are unaffected by
   iceberg areas.  The iceberg areas will expand southward as the game
   progress.


9.7 Airbase Capacity
--------------------
   The maximum combat aircraft capacity for each airbase is listed below:

      Iceland    80     Hamburg      600       Riga     900
      Faroes     60     Scapa Flow   900       America  900
      Bergen    500     Murmansk     900


9.8 NATO Morale
---------------
   NATO Morale will be reduced by long periods of inadequate supply.

A. NATO Morale level will start the game at 100 for compaign 1 or 400 for
   Campaign 2.
B. NATO Morale will be reduced by one point for each turn that the supply
   quantity at Scapa Flow is less than ten or the troop level is less than
   20,000 (200 companies).
C. Morale points may not be regained if Morale level equals zero.  The Soviet
   player will receive 1000 points at the end of the campaign.


9.9 Replacing Cargo Ships
-------------------------
A. During the Campaign Scenarios, any amphibious or cargo ships sunk will be
   replaced by a cargo ship.  The replacement cargo ship will be numbered
   instead of named, have a cargo capacity of 4 and a maximum speed of 20
   knots.
B. Sunk cargo ships (including amphibious) will not be listed on the sunk ship
   display for campaign scenarios.  Points for sunk cargo ships will be
   included in the score displayed before each turn.


9.10 Airfield Repair
--------------------
   When an Airfield is captured it will take between 1-3 days to bring the
airfield to operational status.


9.11 NATO Carrier Early Arrival
-------------------------------
   If between October 1 and November 10 the NATO player is reduced to less than
two American carriers at sea or in the pipeline for less than 5 days, then the
pipeline time of the CV-Kitty Hawk is reduced to five days.  In this event the
Soviet player is awarded 50 victory points.


10.0 GAME DURATION
==================

10.1 Campaign Game Duration
---------------------------
   Campaign games will end after a specified number of turns:
Campaign 1 - 252 turns, Campaign 2 - 122 turns.


10.2 Mini-Game Duration
-----------------------
   Mini-games will end after a specified number of turns.
Mini-game durations are as follows: Convoy QR.44 - 12 turns, Iceland - 20 turns.


11.0 SOLITAIRE PLAY
===================
   When playing solitaire games, the computer will command the Soviet Forces.

A. There are four levels of solitaire difficulty.  The level of difficulty is
   determined at the start of the game.  At level 3, the Soviets will perform
   according to their normal accuracy.  As the level number is decreased, the
   Soviet bomber, torpedo and gunfire accuracy will increase.  These levels may
   be used to handicap a two-player game if desired.
B. It is possible to start a game in solitaire mode, save it and then restart
   it as a two player game.  To do this, set the main menu to two player mode
   before restarting the saved game.
C. It is possible to save a two-player game and restart it as a solitaire game,
   subject to the following restriction.  All Soviet TFs must end the two-
   player segment IN-PORT.


12.0 TWO-PLAYER GAMES
=====================
   When using the two-player format, the following procedure should be
observed.

A. While the NATO player is giving commands to his forces, the Soviet player
   should turn away or leave the room.
B. While the Soviet player is giving commands to his forces, the NATO player
   should turn away or leave the room.
C. During the combat resolution phase, both players should view the results.

15.0 STRATEGY NOTES
===================

SOVIET STRATEGY
---------------
   Soviet strategic goals are: (1) capture and hold the strategic airfields on
Iceland and Faroes: (2) reduce or destroy NATO supply convoys to Great Britain.
Control of Iceland and Faroes is worth 500 VPs each, while a prolonged supply
shortage in Britain is worth 1000 VPs.

FAROES
------
   Faroes Island may be easily captured by a coordinated Soviet airborne
assault.  Within the first 4 turns of the game, the Soviets should drop 22,000+
paratroops on the island and include all available Fencers on ground support.
The airfield will usually be captured within 3 turns of the drop.  The Soviets
should continue attacking the NATO remnants on the island until all have been
eliminated.  Faroes proximity to the other Soviet bases (Bergen, Hamburg) will
make NATO attempts to recapture it extermely difficult.

ICELAND
-------
   The Soviets may employ two methods for capturing Iceland: (1) Airborne
Assault or (2) combined Airborne/Amphibious Assault.  Method (1) should be
attempted on the first turn of the game, before NATO army in reinforcements.
All Backfire and Badger bombers within range should fly ground support (a
mission for which they are not well suited).  With luck the airfield can be
caputred or suppressed on the first turn and a second wave of Soviet airborne
troops can be dropped on the island.  A 3:1 Soviet edge in troop strength will
usually  gaurantee the capture of the airfield and the eventual destruction at
the NATO garrison.
   Should the Soviets fail to capture or suppress the airfield on the first
turn then NATO can fly in 10,000 troops and 44 additional combat aircraft for
the second round of combat.  If NATO reinforcements are allowed to fly, in the
Soviets will find themselves out of supply and outclassed in the air, with
only a marginal superiority in troop strength.  This situation will usually
result in the complete destruction of the assault force over a period of one
or two weeks.
   Method (2) requires the coordination of airborne and amphibious forces for
an assault on Iceland.  The advantage of this method is that it allows the
Soviets to deliver their assault while in supply.  The disadvantage is that the
NATO player can easily react to the threat as the amphibious convoy makes its
approach.
   The Amphibious Assault effort should include three TFs: (1) and amphibious/
transport TF; (2) a bombardment TF; and (3) a Combat Patrol TF.
   The amphibious TF should include all available LPD, LST and AP type ships
and an escort of best ASW type ships (Kara and Kresta-II class CGs and Krivak
class FFGs).  The amphibious TF should transport only supplies!  The
bombardment TF should include the two CLs and a screen of 6 to 8 heavily gunned
DDGs, DDs and FFs.
   The Combat Patrol TF should include all surface ships armed with SSMs.
   The three TFs should move together on the shortest possible course to
Iceland.  Drop paratroops on Iceland on the same turn that the amphibious TF
starts to unload.  Continue dropping troops until there are over 60,000 on
Iceland.  Badgers and Backfires from Bergen and Fencers from Faroes should fly
ground support if possible.
   The assault on Iceland is not a sure thing.  Submarines and bombers can wreck
your amphibious ships and Iceland's CAP can chew up your air transports.
However, with a little luck a well planned assault can overwhelm NATO defenses.

ANTI-SHIP MISSIONS
------------------
   For the first 20 turns the Soviet player must focus on attempts to capture
Faroes and Iceland.  When these operations have been completed (whether
successful or not) he can concentrate on sinking NATO ships for the remainder
of the game.
   Soviet air power will cause the majority of NATO's ship losses.  Soviet
aircraft are generally inferior to NATO aircraft and should be used discreetly
in areas of dense CAP concentrations.  Backfire and Badger bombers may be used
anywhere when launching the AS-6 missile at maximum stand-off range.
   The Soviets should maintain sbout 20 submarines in the mid-Atlantic
throughout the game.  Submarines should be grouped according to speed and
missile type.  Submarines should close to within 1 space of the target before
firing missiles.  If possible, subs should coordinate their missile attacks
with the air and surface missile platforms.
   The Soviet surface fleet is at a severe disadvantage when opposed by
American carriers.  The surface fleet should stand out of range until the big
carriers return to port or are crippled by air attack.  When based in Iceland
the fleet may sortie on short notice against poorly protected NATO convoys.
The surface fleet should attempt to launch SSMs from beyond the range of the
NATO Exocets and Harpoons, and then run for port.

BATTLE OF BRITAIN
-----------------
   The Soviet player must use his land based air force to reduce the build-up
of supplies and aircraft on Scapa Flow.  The Soviet player should include all
of his Bergen based Floggers and Fencers in his raids against Scapa Flow.
Backfires and Badgers should not be included in these missions.  The NATO
forces on Scapa Flow cannot be allowed to become too powerful, the Soviet
player must accept heavy air losses to keep them reduced.

NATO STRATEGY
-------------
   NATO strategic objectives are: (1) maintain a sufficient supply level on
Great Britain and (2) maintain or regain control of the airfields on Faroes
and Iceland.

FAROES
------
   The Faroes garrison cannot establish an effective defense early in the game.
Massive air strikes from Bergen will reduce supplies to nothing and chew up
the defending CAP.  It may be worth while to evacuate the 8000 man garrison by
air.
   NATO Forces should attempt to recapture Faroes only after the maximum number
of aircraft carriers and smphibious ships are available and Iceland is under
NATO control.

ICELAND
-------
   The NATO player has some chance of thwarting the Soviet invasion of Iceland.
To defend Iceland the NATO player must add 300 or more companies of reinforce-
ments and maintain an adequate flow of supplies to the garrison.  NATO supply
ships must deliver at least 50 supply dumps per week to Iceland to sustain an
effective defense.
   NATO can base up to 80 combat aircraft on Iceland.  These aircraft can bomb
Soviet transports as they approach, provide CAP to shoot down Soviet bombers
and air transport and provide ground support after the Soviet troops have
landed.
   If the Soviets gain a substantial numerical advantage in troops over the
Iceland garrison the NATO player should consider evacuating his aircraft.
Soviet land attacks may bring the airfield under fire and ground NATO aircraft
on the following turn.  Beware the possibility of losing the airfield before
the combat aircraft can be evacuated.
   The NATO player should not risk too much to defend Iceland.  NATO can
usually recapture Iceland in November after all the amphibious and cargo ships
become available.

AMPHIBIOUS OPERATIONS
---------------------
   Amphibious operations should include all available ships in the NATO fleet
divided into Task Forces as follows: 1 or 2 (C) carrier TFs, 1 (B) bombardment
TF, 1 (T) amphibious/transport TF, 1 to 3 submarine groups.  Some examples of
TF composition are listed below:

(C) CVN-CVN-CGN-CGN-CGN-CGN-DDG-DDG-DD-DD-FFG-FFG-FF-FF
(C) CV-CV-CG-CG-CG-CG-DDG-DDG-DD-DD-FFG-FFG-FF-FF
(B) BB-BB-DDG-DDG-DD-DD-FF-FF-FF-FF

   All surface TFs should move together on the voyage to the objective, Tomcats
from the escorting carriers should fly long ranged CAP.  Intruders and Corsairs
should pound the objective airfield during the approach and provide ground
support after the troops land.  Starlifters based at Scapa Flow should drop
paratroops on the objective in conjunction with the amphibious landing.  The
bombardment TF should be moved into the objective square to add to the ground
support effect.
   Barring disaster, a well coordinated NATO assault can overwhelm the best
prepared Soviet defense.  Disasters can happen of course.  The loss of one or
more carriers to freak missile or torpedo hits can turn a smooth operation into
a very hairy experience.

NATO CONVOYS
------------
   Convoy operations are required to periodically resupply Iceland or Scapa
Flow.  All convoys to Scapa Flow should be escorted by a carrier TF.  One or
more NATO submarine TFs should accompany the convoy to defend against Soviet
subs.

THE BRITISH FLEET
-----------------
   The majority of the British fleet starts the game based on Iceland.  Some or
all of this force should be withdrawn to America prior to the arrival of the
Soviet Invasion Force.  If the NATO player intends to defend Iceland then those
ships armed with Exocet missiles should remain in the Iceland area to attack
the invaders.  The weak British carriers are best used in ferrying Harriers from
America to Scapa Flow.

THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
---------------------
   The NATO player should attempt to maintain an effective air presence in
Scapa Flow.  Soviet bombing raids with less than a 2:1 advantage in fighters
will consistently suffer heavy losses in daylight attacks.  Soviet night
bombing raids will suffer fewer losses but the bomb accuracy of the Fencer is
reduced by 30%.
   When NATO air strength on Scapa Flow falls below 30 fighters then all air-
craft except the Harriers should be withdrawn to America.
