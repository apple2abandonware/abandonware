1.0 INTRODUCTION
================
REFORGER '88 is a ground tactical game of combat between the forces of NATO and
the Warsaw Pact which takes place at the Fulda Gap in the year 1988.  The game
covers the first week of the war.  The Warsaw Pact attacks with 12 divisions in
an attempt to capture Frankfort and destroy Rhein-Main Air Force Base, NATO
defending with 5 divisions must fight a desperate delaying action.


1.10 Description of Action:
--------------------------
Each game turn consists of 12 hours of operations.  Operations consist of
supplying and moving combat forces, changing formation, planning assaults, air
strikes, airborne mission and artillery bombardments and resolving combat
situations.

1.2 Talking to the Computer:
---------------------------
To enter a response to the computer that consists of numbers (such as a unit ID
number), type the number into the computer and press the <RETURN> key to select
a routine from a menu or answer a Yes/No question just press the desired key.

WHERE THE EXIT COMMAND IS NOT SPECIFIED. PRESS <RETURN> TO QUIT THE ROUTINE.

1.3 Saving the Game:
-------------------
At the end of each player's ORDERS PHASE and at the end of each turn the
computer will allow the player(s) to save the game in progress.  You will need
a scratch disk to store the saved game data.  Save game disks for the Apple
must be initialized for SSI use during a game by following instructions
included in the game program.  Atari users may use any disk that has been
properly formatted for use on the Atari.  Once a game is saved, you will be
able to restart it at the point where you left off.

WHEN RESTARTING A SAVED GAME YOU MUST SET THE CORRECT SOLITAIRE LEVEL AND
NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON THE OPENING MENU.

1.4 The Map:
-----------
The game map covers the battlefields in Central Germany from Kassel in the
north to Wurzburg in the south.  Movement around the map is controlled by a
hexagon grid system (31 x 32 hexes) with each hexagon representing 6 kilo-
meters.

1.5 Starting the Game (Apple):
-----------------------------
To begin the game, boot your game disk and the game will begin automatically.
If you are using an Apple II with Pascal you must first use your BASICs disk,
if you are using an Apple III you must first go into Apple II emulation mode.

1.6 Starting the Game (Atari):
-----------------------------
To begin the game, boot the Scenario side of your disk.  After selecting the

commanded by a human player.  The Warsaw Pact forces may be commanded by either
a human or the computer.

3.1 Determining Conditions of Play:
----------------------------------
At the start of the game the player(s) must determine the conditions under
which the game will be played.  On the Apple version, the conditions may be
changed by entering the following numbers:

     (1) NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
     (2) 1 DISK DRIVE or 2 DISK DRIVES
     (3) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
     (4) SOLITAIRE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY

     (1) NEW GAME or SAVED GAME
     (2) SOLITAIRE or TWO PLAYERS
     (3) SOLITAIRE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY
     (4) SCENARIO SUPPRISE or EARLY WARNING


3.2 Historical Set-Up:
---------------------
At the start of the game, the computer will assign air combat forces to their
starting locations prior to the battle.

3.3 Sequence of Play:
--------------------
  1   NATO Group Adjustment Phase
  2   NATO Supply Phase
  3   NATO Tactical Plot & Road Movement Phase
  4   NATO Air Mission Allocation Phase
  5   NATO Save Game Phase

  9   Warsaw Pact Air Mission Allocation Phase
 10   Warsaw Pact Airborne Phase
 11   Warsaw Pact Save Game Phase
 12   Tactical Execution & Combat Phase
 13   End of Turn Save Game Phase

3.4 Keeping Time:
----------------
Each game turn represents 12 hours, AM turns are daylight turns and PM turns
are night turns.  The calendar days adjusted at the start of each AM turn.  The
"Suprise" scenario starts on 5/8/88 AM.  The "Early Warning" scenario starts on
5/8/88 PM.

3.5 Game Duration:
-----------------
Either player may end the game during his GROUP ADJUSTMENT PHASE.  Both players
should agree when ending the game in this manner.  The game will end automatic-
ally at the end of the 5/15/88 AM turn.

3.6 Limited Intelligence:
------------------------
The players' knowledge of the opposing forces location and strength will be
limited.  Opposing forces will be displayed on the map only if they have been
in contact with friendly ground forces or sighted by friendly recon aircraft.
All NATO units are considered sighted on the first turn of the suprise attack
scenario.


4.0 GROUP ADJUSTMENT PHASE
==========================
During the group adjustment phase the player(s) may divide their combat groups,
transfer units from one group to another, renumber their groups, view the map
display, air group display, casually display, declare chemical warfare, adjust
the delay loop or end the game.

4.1 Combat Groups:
-----------------
Combat groups may contain from 1 to 5 brigades, regiments or battalions (units)
.  Each combat group (CG) has an identification number and a divisional
designation.  It is possible for more than one CG to have the same divisional
designation.  Different CGs will never have the same group idenification (ID)
number.
   Group ID numbers 1-63 are reserved for NATO CGs.  Group ID numbers 64-127
are reserved for Warsaw Pact CGs.

   EXAMPLE    12 PANZER   GROUP 5

The example shows the CG's divisional designation and group ID number as it
would appear on your display, 12 PANZER is the divisional designation and "5"
is the group ID number.

4.2 Combat Units:
----------------
Each CG may contain from 1 to 5 combat units (CUs).  CUs are given a
descriptive name to reflect its basic function.  Each CU may contain up to 6
different weapon systems.

   EXAMPLE    PZG BN
              36 MARDER  39 MILAN  6 120M
              12 JPZ-RK

In the example a CU is shown as it would appear on your display, PZG BN is the
descriptive name.  The CU contains 4 different weapon systems, 36 Marder armor-
ed personnel carriers (each containing 1 squad of infantry), 39 Milan missile
teams, 6 120mm mortar teams and 12 JPz Rakete self propelled missile systems.

4.3 Dividing Combat Groups:
--------------------------
Enter the group ID number of the CG you wish to divide.  The computer will
automatically select the lowest numbered "empty" group to receive the divided
units.  The computer will then list the units in the dividing CG.  Enter the
unit number (0-4) for each unit you wish to transfer to the new CG.  When you
have completed your transfers just press <RETURN> to quit the routine.
   The newly formed CG will have the same divisional designation morale rating
and supply level as the dividing CG.

4.4 Transferring Units:
----------------------
Units may be transferred between two CGs that occupy the same hexagon on the
map.  Both the "gaining" and "losing" CG must have the same divisional
designation.
   Enter the group ID number of the losing CG.  The computer will automatically
select the other CG in the hex as the gaining CG.  The procedure for transferr-
ing units is the same as described in 4.3.  A CG may never contain more than 5
units.
   If the morale rating of the gaining CG is greater than the morale rating of
the losing CG, then the morale of the gaining CG will be reduced to the level
of the losing CG.

4.5 The Map Display:
-------------------
The map used in REFORGER '88 employs a hexagon grid 32 hexes high by 31 hexes
wide.  Only a fraction of the map (7 hexes high by 13 hexes wide) may be viewed
at one time.  By pressing the keys 1-6 the cursor can be moved around the map
(1-N, 2-NE, 3-SE, 4-S, 5-SW, 6-NW).  If the cursor is moved to the edge of the
display then the map display will scroll to reveal the hidden portions of the
map.
   West German combat group symbols contain the letters "GE", American combat
group symbols will contain "US", Soviet combat group symbols contain the
letters "SU", East German combat group symbols will contain the letters "EG".
Two Warsaw Pact groups stacked together will contain the symbols "WP" or "W".
Two NATO groups stacked together will contain the symbols "NA" or "N".  All
frinedly CGs will be shown on the display.  Enemy CGs will be displayed only if
they were "sighted" during the previous turn's Combat Phase.

4.6 Ending the Game:
-------------------
The players may elect to end the game during the Group Adjustment Phase.  The
computer will display the final score.

4.7 Renumbering Combat Groups:
-----------------------------
CGs may be renumbered using the RENUMBER GROUP routine.  Enter the number of
the CG you wish to renumber and the new number you wish to assign it.  The new
number may not duplicate the ID number of a CG currently on the map.

4.8 Declaring Chemical Warfare:
------------------------------
Only the Warsaw Pact player may declare chemical warfare.  After chemical
warfare has been declared the effects of all airstrikes and bombardments (both
Warsaw Pact and NATO) will be enhanced (see 8.8).

4.9 Air Group Display:
---------------------
The AIR GROUP DISPLAY routine may be used to view the current operational
aircraft levels for each NATO squadron or Warsaw Pact air regiment available to
the players.

4.10 Delay Adjustments:
----------------------
During the Tactical Execution and Combat Phase flexible delay loops have been
inserted to allow the players to accelerate or slow the pace.  The DELAY ADJUST
routine may be used to alter the delays as desired.

4.11 Casualty Reports:
---------------------
Players may look at a report listing friendly and enemy losses incurred during
the previous turn.  The report of friendly losses is accurate, but the report
of enemy losses is usually exaggerated.  Players may look at the report of
enemy losses only once per turn.


5.0 SUPPLY PHASE
================
Supply points are used each time a CG moves or performs a combat function.
During the supply phase the player(s) move their depots to the front line areas
to replenish the supplies of their CGs.

5.1 Depot Movement:
------------------
NATO depots always start their movement on an autobahn hex on the west edge of
the map.  Warsaw Pact depots always start their movement on an autobahn hex on
the east edge of the map.  Depots always start their move with a supply level
of 25.  A depot's supply level represents the maximum number of supply points
it may distribute to EACH friendly CG.
   Depots may be moved in the various directions by pressing keys 1-6 (1-N,
2-NE, 3-SE, 4-S, 5-SW, 6-NW).  For each hex a depot moves its supply level will
be decreased.  The supply level reduction varies with the type of terrain
entered as shown below:

     clear       1
     woods       1
     rough       4
     city        1
     autobahn    1/4

To qualify for the autobahn supply reduction rates the depot must be moving
directly from one autobahn/city hex to another autobahn/city hex.
   The players may elect to use the AUTO-MOVE DEPOT function to move their
depots near the front line.  Auto-moved depots will always follow their
programmed path until they are stopped by an enemy ZOC.
   A depot that moves adjacent to an enemy CG will be lost for the remainder
of the turn (each player has 4 depots).  Warsaw Pact depots may never enter a
NATO controlled city hex.  A depot may not cross an unbridged river hexside.

5.2 Supply Distribution:
-----------------------
At any time during a depot's move the depot may distribute supplies by pressing
the (S)UPPLY key.  All friendly CGs within 2 hexes of the depot may receive
supplies.  CGs may only receive supplies once per supply phase.  CGs that
receive supplies will disappear from the map for the remainder of the supply
phase.
   The number of supply points received by a CG will be equal to the supply
level of the depot.

5.3 New Depots:
--------------
The player(s) may request new depots at any time during the supply phase by
pressing the (N)EW DEPOT key.  The new depot will begin on the same side of the
map, but on a different autobahn hex.  NATO depots may enter on four different
autobahn hexes on the west edge of the map.  Warsaw Pact depots may enter on
four different autobahn hexes on the east edge of the map.  The entry autobahn
hexes will be changed each time a new depot is requested.  The player should
continue pressing the (N) key until the depot begins in the desired area.

5.4 Supply Usage:
----------------
CGs use supply points for all movement and most fire missions.  Supply costs
and restrictions are listed below:

                             COST         MINIMUM
        road move              1             1
        tactical move          3             3
        retreat                3             3
        opportunity fire       2             6
        offensive fire         3             6
        defensive fire         3             6
        1/2 def fire           0             0
        bombardment            6            12
        build bridge           6            12


The number listed in the MINIMUM column is the number quantity of supplies a
CG must have to perform a particular mission.  Thus a CG must have 12 supply
points to perform a bombardment even though it will only use 6 of them.
   Unsupplied CGs may not move or perform any fire missions except defensive
fire (at 50% normal effectiveness).

5.5 Refugees:
------------
In the first two days of the war the Autobahns in West Germany will be jammed
with relugees fleeing the war zone.  Prior to the 5/10/88 AM game turn both the
Warsaw Pact and NATO will be unable to use the autobahns to move supplies or
combat groups
   Prior to 5/10/88, depots will not receive the road movement bonus.

5.6 NATO Replacements:
---------------------
Starting 5/10/88 AM the NATO player may receive replacements for some of his
depleted battalions.  Replacements will be automatically added to depleted
battalions during the supply distribution process.
   Replacement will be added under the following conditions:

   PANZER BATTALIONS with less then 37 LEOPARDs will receive 17 LEOPARDs

   TANK BATTALIONS with less than 37 ABRAMS will receive 17 ABRAMS

   PZG BATTALIONS with less than 25 MARDERs will receive 12 MARDERs and 12
   MILANs

   MECH INF BATTALIONS with less than 19 M-2s will receive 9 M-2s and 9
   DRAGONs

The number or replacement weapon systems received each turn varies with the
SOLITAIRE LEVEL as shown below:

       LEVEL           1         2         3         4
       LEOPARD         0        12        34        51
       MARDER          0        12        24        36
       MILAN           0        12        24        36
       M-2             0         9        18        27
       DRAGON          0         9        18        27

Replacements will be distributed to the FIRST ELIGIBLE BATTALIONS that receive
supplies during the turn.  Unused replacements will be accumulated for use
during later turns.


6.0 TACTICAL PLOT - ROAD MOVEMENT PHASE
=======================================
During the tactical plot/road movement phase the player(s) may alter the mode
of their CGs perform road movement with CGs in "road" mode, plot tactical
movement for CGs in "assault" or "mobile" mode or plot bombardment fire for CGs
in "static" mode.  CGs may also plot recon, bridge demolition or bridge
contruction missions.

6.1 Selecting Combat Groups:
---------------------------
Move the cursor over the CG to be moved/plotted and press the (G)ET UNIT key.
The computer will display the CG's designation, group ID number and mode.  If
there are two CGs in the hex and you wish to go to the other CG then press
(Q)UIT key to get the bottom CG in the stack.
   When you have completed your movement/Plots for a CG you may hit the (Q)UIT
key and move the cursor to get another friendly CG instead of the (Q)UIT key,
you may hit the (N)EXT GROUP key and the computer will automatically "get" the
CG with the next highest group ID number.

6.2 Mode Selection:
------------------
A CG's mode will affect its ability to move and fight during the current turn.
CGs in road mode may fire only their tank type weapon system during the current
turn.  The movement rates and defense adjustments for each mode are shown
below:


                    MOVE    DEFENSE
    static           0      x 1.5
    assault          1      x 1.0
    mobile           3      x .75
    road            18      x .62


You may alter the current mode of a CG by pressing the S, A, M or R keys.  A
CG may not be placed in road mode unless it currently occupies an autobahn or
city hex.  CGs may not be placed in road mode if they are currently adjacent to
an enemy CG.

6.3 Road Movement:
-----------------
Only CGs in road mode may employ road movement.  When using road movement, a CG
may only enter autobahn or city hexes.  CGs may never move adjacent to an
enemy CG when using road movement.  A CG may never enter a hex that is
currently occupied by TWO friendly CGs.  CGs may never use road movement across
an unbridged river hexside.  Soviet units in road mode may not enter a NATO
controlled city.
   It is possible to use part of a CG's road movement allowance, then move or
plot other groups, and finish the CG's movement later in the turn.
   CGs may not enter ROAD MOVE or use road movement prior the 5/10/88 AM turn
(see 5.5).

6.4 Plotting Tactical Movement:
------------------------------
All movement except road movement must be planned in advance (plotted) during
the TACTICAL PLOT - ROAD MOVEMENT PHASE.  CGs perform their planned moves
during the TACTICAL EXECUTION & COMBAT PHASE.
   A tactical plot consists of from 1 to 3 number with each number representing
an instruction to move in a particular direction during a particular TACTICAL
EXECUTION segment.  There are 3 movement segments during the TACTICAL EXECUTION
& COMBAT PHASE.  The first number in the tactical plot instructs the CG to move
in a particular direction during the first movement segment, the second number
in the tactical plot refers to the second segments, etc.
   Listed in the next columns a summary of the legal movement plots.

      1    move north
      2    move northeast
      3    move southeast
      4    move south
      5    move southwest
      6    move northwest
      0    do not move this segment

EXAMPLE:     PLOT 032

In the example tactical plot shown above the CG would not move during segment
1, would move southeast during segment 2 and northeast during segment 3.
   Only CGs in assault or mobile mode may perform tactical movement.  The
number of hexes that may be moved using tactical movement is affected by the
CG's mode.  Tactical movement allowances are shown below:

     assault    1
     mobile     3

CGs in assault mode may execute their 1 move during any of the three movement
segments (a plot of 003 would instruct a CG to save its move until the 3rd
movement segment).
   The AFB RHEIN-MAIN unit may never be moved.

6.5 Combat Situations:
---------------------
Combat situations will occur whenever a CG attempts to execute a tactical move
into a hex occupied by an enemy CG.  If more than one friendly CG attempt to
enter a particular enemy occupied hex during the same movement segment then
these friendly CGs will combine their combat strengths to attack the enemy
CG(s) in the hex.
   An "S" command may be inserted at the end of a CG's tactical plot if you
want to CG to attack in a particular direction but no move or advance.  The S
should be the last figure in the tactical plot, any instructions that appear
after the S will be ignored.  The S command will affect only the last segments
in which movement is plotted.

EXAMPLE:     PLOT  111S

In the example, the CG would move north during segments 1 & 2. During segment
3 the CG would attack if the hex to the north is enemy occuped but would not
move on advance after combat.
   The maximum length of a tactical plot is four symbols.

6.6 Plotting Bombardments:
-------------------------
Only CGs in static mode may perform bombardments.  To perform a bombardment a
CG must contain long-range weapon systems:

     M107         M109         M110           110RL
     122SPH       152SPH       122FH          152FH

     122RL        203RL        204RL
     130FH        180FH

Eligible CGs may bombard enemy CG either 1 or 2 hexes away.
   Bombardments are plotted the same as tactical movement bombardment of plots
must start with a "B" symbol.  The 2nd (and 3rd) sysmbol(s) indicate the
direction the guns are firing.

EXAMPLE:   PLOT  B12

In the example plot the target hex is located 2 hexes away one hex in direction
1 and one hex in direction 2.

EXAMPLE:   PLOT  B3

In the example plot the target hex is located one hex in direction 3.

6.7 Plotting Recon Missions:
---------------------------
CGs may perform recon missions to "observe" the contents of an adjacent hex.
Recon plots must start with an "R" symbol.  The second symbol indicates the
direction (from the recon CG) to be searched.

EXAMPLE:   PLOT  R4

In the example plot, the CG will search the adjacent hex to the south.
   Recon missions are executed BEFORE the tactical movement segments.

6.8 Plotting Bridge Demolition:
------------------------------
Players may attempt to destroy bridge hexsides by plotting bridge demolition
missions for their CGs.  A bridge demolition plot must start with an "X" symbol
followed by a number (1-6) representing the direction of the bridge hexside
relative to the CG.

EXAMPLE:   PLOT  X3

In the example shown above bridge demolition has been plotted for the bridge
hexside located southeast of the plotting CG.
   CGs that do not contain engineer battalions will have a 30% chance of
destroying the bridge hexside.  CGs that contain an engineer battalion will
have their chance of destroying the bridge enhanced (95% for a full strength
and undisrupted engineer battalion).

6.9 Plotting Bridge Construction:
--------------------------------
CGs that contain engineer battalions may plot a bridge construction mission.  A
bridge construction plot must start with a "C" symbol followed by a number (1-
6) representing the direction of the river hexside to be bridged relative to
the building CG.

EXAMPLE:   PLOT  C4

In the example shown above the CG will attempt to construct a bridge across the
river hexside located to the south.
   A full strength and undisrupted NATO engineer battalion will have a 90%
chance of successfully constructing the bridge hexside.  A full strength and
undisrupted Warsaw Pact engineer battalion will have a 70% chance.  The chance
of success will be reduced if the engineer battalion has suffered losses and/or
disruption.


7.0 AIR MISSIONS
================
The players may assign friendly air group (squadrons/regiments) to fly air
superiority group attack air recon or bridge attack missions.  The Warsaw Pact
may assign its three airborne regiments to be air dropped.

7.1 Air Superiority Missions:
----------------------------
At the start of the Air Missions Phase, the players may assign air groups to
air superiority missions.  The computer will display the air group one at the
time, showing the type and quantity of aircraft.  The player may assign the
group to air superiority by pressing the <A> key.  If the <N> key to pressed
the current group will NOT be assigned to air superiority and the computer will
display the next air group.  If the <S> key is pressed, the current group will
NOT be assigned and the computer will skip past all remaining groups with the
same aircraft type as the current group if the <E> key is press then the
computer will EXIT the air superiority selection routine.

7.2 Planning Airstrikes:
-----------------------
Each player may plan up to 10 airstrikes each turn.  The player may move the
cursor to the desired target by pressing 1-6 directional keys.  Press the
(S)ELECT TARGET key when the cursor is over the hex you wish to attack.  Air
groups are assigned to  stike missions in the same manner that they are
assigned to air superiority missions.
   After all air groups have been assigned to a particular strike, press the
<E> key to EXIT the group assignment routine.  The computer will allow you to
choose either BRIDGE, RECON or GROUND ATTACK in the target hex.  To attack a
bridge hexside in the target hex press a numeric key (1-6) to indicate the
direction of the bridge hexside from the target cursor.  Air Recon missions
will attempt to sight enemy CGs within two hexes of the "target" hex (see 7.6).

7.3 Combat Aircraft:
-------------------
Combat aircraft included in the game are listed below including their ratings
for air superiority (AS), ground attack (GA), defense (DF) and all-weather
avionics (AW):


       F-15                12     10      9       6
       F-16                10      6      7       4
       PHANTOM              7     12      7       6
       TORNADO              9     14      8       9
       F-111                3     20      8       9
       A-10                 2     16      2       3
       PAH-1                0      6      3       1
       AH-64                0     10      8       5
       RF-4                 1      0     14       9

       MIG-29               9      6      7       5
       MIG-23               8      1      4       4
       SU-25                3      8      5       4
       SU-24                3     10      6       7
       SU-17                2      6      4       4
       MIG-27               4      7      6       6
       MI-8                 0      1      2       1
       MI-24                0      5      4       1
       MIG-25R              1      0      8       6

Aircraft with an AS rating of zero are helicopters.  Aircraft with a GA rating
of zero are recon naissance aircraft.  It is strongly suggested that the NATO
player use his F-15, F-16, PHANTOM, and TORNADO aircraft on air superiority
missions until an advantage over the Warsaw Pact is achieved.  The Warsaw Pact
player should use his MIG aircraft on air superiority missions.

7.4 Flying Conditions:
---------------------
The ability of the aircraft to perform the missions may be affected by two
element time of day (AM/PM) and the weather (clear, overcast).  These two
elements are combine to form the following conditions:

      GOOD     AM & CLEAR weathter
      FAIR     AM & OVERCAST weather
      FAIR     PM & CLEAR weather
      POOR     PM & OVERCAST weather

When conditions are GOOD all aircraft perform at 100% effectiveness.  When
condition are FAIR  or POOR aircraft will preform at only a fraction of their
normal effectiveness a determined by their all-weather (AW) ratings.

           AW      FAIR        POOR
            9       90%         81%
            8       80%         64%
            7       70%         49%
            6       60%         36%
            5       50%         25%
            4       40%         16%
            3       30%          9%
            2       20%          4%
            1       10%          1%

The weather is determined at the start of each turn.  There is a 50% chance
that the weather will be OVERCAST.

7.5 Airborne Missions:
---------------------
The Warsaw Pact has three airborne regiments that may be air dropped onto the
map.  Selection of the drop zone is similar to selecting an airstrike target
hex.  Airborne regiments may not be air dropped into NATO controlled cities or
hexes occupied by NATO CGs (if attempted the drop will be aborted).

7.6 Air Recon Missions:
----------------------
Recon missions are flown for the purpose of sighting enemy CGs.  Recon missions
count towards the maximum limit of 10 airstrikes per turn.  ANY TYPE OF
AIRCRAFT MAY FLY RECON MISSIONS.  The specialized recon aircraft (RF-4 and MIG-
25R) are best suited for the reconnaissance role.  Aircraft with higher AW
ratings will have the best chance of sighting enemy CGs.  FAIR or POOR flying
conditions will reduce the chance of sighting enemy CGs.


8.0 COMBAT RESULTS CALCULATIONS
===============================
There aer 5 types of combat that occur in the game: (1) airstrike, (2)
bombardment, (3) opportunity fire, (4) defensive fire, (5) offensive fire.  All
forms of combat use the same general method for calculating casualities ATTACK
STRENGTH/DEFENSE STRENGTH = CASUALTIES.  The attack and defense strengths may
be modified according to the type of combat terrain, or CG mode.  Also a random
factor is added to all combat calculations.

8.1 Weapon Systems:

All systems that have a DS greater than 3 are considered to be HARD target
types.  Systems with a DS less than 4 are considered to be SOFT target types AP
and GM type weapons are designed to destroy HARD targets while HE and I type
weapons are designed to destroy SOFT targets.  AP and GM weapons are assumed to
have an AS of 1 when attacking SOFT targets.  HE and I weapons are assumed to
have an AS of 1 when attacking HARD targets.
   Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) each carry one squad of infantry.  When a
CG is in STATIC or ASSAULT mode then its APCs will have DISMOUNTED INFANTRY and
will be treated as SOFT targets.  When a CG is in MOBILE or ROAD mode then its
APCs will have their infantry embarked and will be treated as HARD targets.
Dismounted infantry may perform an active combat role, embarked infantry will
add nothing to combat situations.
   Weapons that have a DF of 4 are defined as PROTECTED WEAPONS.  Protected
weapons are treated as HARD targets if their CG is in MOBILE or ROAD mode.
Protected weapons are treated as SOFT targets if their CG is in STATIC or
ASSAULT mode.  Protected weapons are most effective in their SOFT target
configuration.
   TANK type weapons are assumed to have an AS of 6 when using OFFENSIVE FIRE
against SOFT targets.
   I type weapons have their AS enhanced when using DEFENSIVE FIRE against
TANKS IF ,the attacking TANKS outnumber the attacking DISMOUNTED INFANTRY squads
(the degreee of enhancement varies with the attacking TANK to DISMOUNTED
INFANTRY ratio).
   CGs in road mode may only fire with their tanks.
   CGs in static mode have their AS DOUBLED.
   During OPPORTUNITY FIRE, HE and AP type weapons may fire using 1/2 of their
normal AS.  GM type weapons fire using their normal AS.  I type weapons may not
perform opportunity fire.

8.2 Disruption:
--------------
In addition to taking casualties, a CG will suffer "disruption" when attacked.
The disruption will be equal to the ATTACK STRENGTH/TOTAL TARGETS.
   CGs that are attacked more than once in a turn will accumulate disruption
points (up to 99).  At the start of each turn all CGs will have their
disruption points returned to ZERO.
   After combat, assaulting CGs will have their disruption level reduced by
their morale rating (if the morale rating is 80 then the disruption level is
reduced by 80%).

8.3 Disrutpion Effects:
----------------------
Following OFFENSIVE FIRE, if a defending CG's disruption level is greater than
its morale rating and the attacker disruption level is less than 90, then the
defending CG will be forced to retreat (unless the attacker has insufficient AP
strength to match the defender's number of tanks).
   If a CG's disruption level is greater than its morale rating then it will be
unable to move any further that turn.
   When firing a CG's attack strength will be reduced by its disruption level
(if the disruption level is 50 then the AS is reduced by 50%).

8.4 Terrain Effects:
-------------------
HARD targets defending in a WOODS ROUGH or CITY hex will have their defense
strength DOUBLED SOFT targets defending in a CITY or ROUGH hex will have their
defense strength QUADRUPLED.  SOFT targets defending in WOODS have their
defense strength DOUBLED.
   CGs may only cross river hexsides if they are in ASSAULT or ROAD mode.  CGs
in ROAD mode may only cross bridged river hexsides.  CGs in ASSAULT mode gain
between 25 and 100 disruption points when moving or attackin across a river
hexside.
   Warsaw Pact CGs may only enter a NATO controlled city hex using tactical
movement.  After a Warsaw Pact CG enters the city hex it becoms an OVERRUN CITY
and its symbol on the map will change.

8.5 Zones of Control:
--------------------
Evely CG has a zone of control (ZOC) that consists of the hex that it occupies
and the six adjacent hexes.
   Friendly depots or CGs in road mode may never enter an enemy ZOC.  If a CG
moves directly from one enemy ZOC into another enemy ZOC (except as a result of
a forced retreat from combat), then that CG may be attacked by enemy
OPPORTUNITY FIRE (see 9.4).  CGs may not retreat into an enemy ZOC unless the
retreat hex is currently occupies by a friendly CG in either static or assault
mode.

8.6 Attacks Strength Allocation:
-------------------------------
In most combat situations, the CG being attacked will consist of several
different weapon systems in calculating combat results the total attack
strength is divided to attack each weapon system sperately.  The percentage
of the total attack strength to attack each weapon system is equal to NUMBER
IN WEAPON SYSTEM/TOTAL TARGETS

EXAMPLE:     DEFENDING CG CONTAINS
             30 T-80   20-T72

In the example, 60% of the total attack strength would be used against the
T-80s and 40% would be use again the T-72s.

8.7 Morale Reduction:
--------------------
CGs have their morale rating reduced by 1 point each time they perform an
assault or are attacked CGs with a morale less than 50 will gain 1 morale point
at the start of each trun.
   Additional morale reduction may occur as at result of bombardments or
airstrikes using chemical weapons.

8.8 Chemical Warfare:
--------------------
After chemical warefare has been declared effectiveness of a airstrikes and
bombbardments will be enhanced.  Only Warsaw Pact airstrikes and bombardments
will be enhanced on the turn chemical warfare is declared.  The effectiveness
of chemical air strikes and bombardments is adjusted as follows.
   (1) DOUBLED
   (2) DOUBLED on the turn chemical warfare is declared
   (3) DOUBLED when used against American CGs (only for the first two times
       that the unit experiences a chemical attack).
   (4) HALVED when used against a CG that has previously experienced a chemical
       attack.

The adjustments shown above are cumulative
   CGs will suffer a 4-point morale loss the first time they are attacked with
chemical weapons and a 2-pont morale loss for any subsequent chemical attack.
American CGs will suffer a 10-point morale loss for the first, a 4-point morale
loss for the second and a 2-point morale loss for any subsequent chemical
attack.

8.9 Sighting Enemy Forces:
-------------------------
Enemy CGs may only be sighted during the Combat Phase.  Enemy CGs will be
sighted as follows:

   (1) successful air reconnaissance
   (2) enemy CG moves adjacent to friendly CG
   (3) enemy CG uses OFFENSIVE, DEFENSIVE or OPPORTUNITY FIRE
   (4) enemy CG adjacent to friendly CG at the end of the Combat Phase

Enemy CGs sighted during the Combat Phase will remain "visible" for the
duration of the following turn.


9.0 TACTICAL EXECUTION & COMBAT PHASE
=====================================
During the tactical execution & combat phase (TEC phase), movement and combat
functions are performed in the following sequence:

   1. air superiority airstrike & air recon resolution
   2. air drop, bombardment, construction, demolition & land recon resolution
   3. segment 1
      a. NATO movement
      b. NATO attack resolution
      c. Warsaw Pact movement
      d. Warsaw Pact attack resolution
   4. segment 2
   5. segment 3

There is a 20% chance that the Warsaw Pact will move and attack before NATO
when playing at solitaire level 3.  This chance is increased by 20% per level
as the solitaire level is DECREASED.

9.1A Air superiority Resolution:
-------------------------------
During air superiority combat the total air wuperiority points (TASP) for each
side are used to attack the enemy air superiority squadrons/regiments.  Air-to-
air forces for each air group are equal to ENEMY TASP/(NUMBER FRIENDLY AIR
SUPERIORITY GROUPS x DEFENSE STRENGTH).  A random factor is included in the
calculation of aircraft losses.
   The interception points (IP) are equal to one-half of the difference between
NATO and Warsaw pact TASP.

EXAMPLE:   TASP   NATO = 1200
           WARSAW PACT = 1000
           IP = NATO + 100
           ((1200 - 1000)/2 = 100)

The IP will intercept each enemy airstrike

9.1B Airstrike Resolution:
-------------------------
Prior to attacking the target each air group in the airstrike must be attacked
by the enemy IP and the area flak strength (AFS).  AFS is equal to the combined
attack strengths of air short range anti-aircraft weapons in the target hex
plus all long range anti-aircraft weapons within two hexes of the target hex.
   The IP and AFS are used to destroy the bombing aircraft and/or reduce their
effectiveness.  The percentage of effectiveness loss is equal to (IP+AFS)/1000.
   Airstrikes will cause casualties and disruption in the target CS(s).
Targets which are highly concentrated (over 300 weapons systems) will suffer
additional losses.  The greater the number of weapons systems, the larger the
amount or additional losses.  Airstrikes directed against bridge hexsides
should include 250 ground attack points (adjusted for weather etc.) to have a
50% chance of success.

9.1R Air Recon Resolution:
-------------------------
Recon aircraft may be destroyed or reduced in effectiveness by flak/intercept-
ion in the same manner as bombing aircraft.  Surviving recon aircraft will
search the area within two hexes of the target.  The SEARCH ABILITY of the
recon mission is euqal to NUMBER AIRCRAFT x AW RATING.  Search effectiveness
is also reduced by FAIR or POOR flying conditions.

9.1X Non-Combat Aircraft Losses:
-------------------------------
Air groups will suffer 5% losses (on the average) each turn that they fly a
combat mission.

9.2A Air Drop Resolution:
------------------------
Airborne Groups that are "dropped" onto the map will suffer casualties and
disruption from the terrain they land in, NATO flak and interception and/or
adverse flying conditions.

     rough    200         night (PM)      200
     woods    100         overcast        100

The above numbers are added to the NATO interception points and flak strength
to "attack" the air-dropped CG (the attack has the same effect as an airstrike)

9.2B Bombardment Resolution:
---------------------------
Only the long range artillery (LRA) type weapons may fire bombardments.  During
PM turns, bombardment effectiveness will be HALVED Bombardments cause
casualties and disruption in the target CG(s).  The effectiveness of the
bombardment may be reduced if the firing CG had been previously hit by air-
strikes or bombardments.  Target which are hihgly concentrated will suffer
additional losses (see section 9.1B).

9.2C Bridge Construction:
------------------------
Bridge Construction is resolved during the TEC phase.  The chance of consturct-
ion may be reduced by casualities/disruption that occur during prior airstrikes
/bombardments.

9.2D Bridge Demolition:
----------------------
Bridge demolition occurs during the TEC phase.  The chance or demolition may be
reduced by casualities/disruption that occur during prior airstrikes/bombard-
ments.

9.2R Recon Reports:
------------------
For each recon mission the computer will display the approximate number of
TANKS, G/M, and APCs in the searched hex.  all artillery and AA systems will be
included in the G/M total.

9.3 Tactical Movement:
---------------------
CGs will execute tactical movement in accordance with their tactical plots.
Tactical movement may initiate OPPORTUNITY FIRE or ASSAULT COMBAT.
   CGs that have a disruption level greater than their morale rating will be
unable to execute their remaining tactical plots.  A CG may not move into a
hex that is currently occupied by TWO friendly CGs (its remaining tactical plot
will be aborted).

9.4 Opportunity Fire:
--------------------
If a CG moves directly from one enemy ZOC into another enemy ZOC the the CG may
be targeted for OPPORTUNITY FIRE.  Enemy CGs may fire if they are adjacent to
the hex in which the moving CG started AND adjacent to the hex that the moving
CG enters.  CGs in road mode may not use opportunity fire.
   Only AP, HE and GM type weapon systems will perform opportunity fire.
Opportunity fire is resolved at 1/4 of the normal attack strength for AP and HE
weapons and at 1/2 for GM weapons.  During PM turns, opportunity fire attack
strengths will be HALVED.
   During opportunity fire the computer will display the ANTI-SOFT/ANTI-HARD
attack strengths of the firing CGs.

9.5 Assault Combat:
------------------
Assault combat is initiated whenever a CG attempts to enter a hex occupied by
an enemy CG.  Assault combat is resolved at the end of the movement segment.
All CGs that attempted to enter the same enemy hex will combine their attack
strengths.
   Assault combat consists of (1) defensive fire, and (2) offensive fire.  The
CG(s) in the "enemy" hex combine their attack strengths to perform defensive
fire.  During offensive fire all weapon systems except tanks and dismounted
infantry will have their attack strengths halved.
   Offensive and defensive fire are resolved simultaneously.

9.6 Retreats:
------------
Following assault combat, defending CGs will be forced to retreat if their
disruption level is greater than their morale rating and the attackers'
disruption is less than 90.  CGs may not retreat into a hex that is currently
occupied by TWO friendly CGs.  CGs may not retreat if they have less than 3
supply points if the defending CG(s) are unable to retreat then they will be
destroyed instead.

9.7 Advance After Combat:
------------------------
Following assault combat, if the defender was forced to retreat then the
attacking CG(s) may advance into the vacated hex.  CGs may not advance if their
disruption level is greater than their morale rating.  A maximum of TWO of the
attacking CGs may advance after combat.  CGs that FAIL to advance after assault
combat will have the remainder of their tactical plot canceled.  CGs that
advance after combat will have their disruption level reduced according to
their morale rating (if the morale rating is 80 then the disruption level is
reduced by 80%).

9.8 Combat Reports:
------------------
As each type of attack is being resolved the computer will display the DISRUPT-
ION points added to the defending and attacking forces.

9.9 NATO Cities:
---------------
Whenever a Soviet unit enters a city hex the city is considered to have been
overrun.  A city once overrun is no longer considered to be NATO controlled.
The NATO player may never regain control of a city that has been overrun.

10.0 WEATHER
============
The weather may be either CLEAR or OVERCAST.  The weather is subject to change
at the start of each turn.  There is a 50% chance of OVERCAST each turn when
playing as solitaire level 3.  The chance of OVERCAST is decreased 10% per
level as the solitaire level is decreased.

11.0 VICTORY DETERMINATION
==========================
At the end of the game the computer calculates the score.  Victory is
determined based upon point differentials.

11.1 Scoring:
------------
Victory Points (VPs) are awarded for the control of cities and for surviving
combat forces.  NATO receives 2000 VPs for each NATO controlled city hex.
Warsaw Pact scores 100000 VPs for destroying the Rhein-Main AFB.  The Warsaw
Pact is awarded 50000 VPs if chemical warfare is not declared during the game.
In the surprise attack scenario the NATO player will receive 25,000 points.
   Points awarded for each surviving WEAPON are equal to the weapon's AS plus
its DS.

EXAMPLE    T-80 = 24 VP  (13 + 11)
           157FH = 5 VP  (4 + 1)

VPs are awarded for surviving aircraft equal to the aircraft's AS + GA + DF +
AW ratings.
   Warsaw Pact will have their points per weapon system multiplied for CGs that
have advanced west of hex column 21.  The MULTIPLE will be equal to 3/(((X-1)/
10)+1) with X being the x-coordinate of the CG.

11.2 Victory Levels:
-------------------
To determine the victory level, subtract the total NATO VPs from the total
Warsaw Pact VPs and compare the result to the following table.

         0 or less          NATO decisive
         1 -   25000        NATO substantive
     25001 -   50000        NATO marginal
     50001 -   75000        Draw
     75001 -  100000        WP marginal
    100001 -  125000        WP substantive
    125001 or more          WP decisive


12.0 SOLITAIRE PLAY
===================
When playing solitaire games the computer will command the Warsaw Pact forces.
There are 4 levels of solitaire difficulty.  The level of difficulty is
determined when starting a new game and may be altered when restarting a saved
game.  As the level number is DECREASED, the balance of air power will shift in
favor of the Warsaw Pact.  CLEAR weather will occur more frequently NATO
reinforcements will arrive later thatn normal.  Warsaw Pact reinforcements will
arrive earlier than normal and NATO will receive fewer replacements.  These
levels may be used to handicap a two player game if desired Level 3 is
considered the "historical" level.
   It is possible to start a game in solitaire mode, save it and restart it as
a two-player game.  To do this set the main menu to two-player mode before
reloading the saved game data.
