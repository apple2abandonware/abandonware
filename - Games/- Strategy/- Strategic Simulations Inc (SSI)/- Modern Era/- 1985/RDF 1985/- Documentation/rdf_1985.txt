0.0 INTRODUCTION TO RDF 1985: 

AS NATO AND WARSAW PACT TANKS BATTLED FOR CONTROL OF THE WEST GERMAN PLAIN, AN
ELITE SOVIET PARA ASSALUT REGIMENT, FLYING AT NIGHT FROM AIRFIELDS IN SOVIET
CENTRAL ASIA, SIEZED THE STATEGIC SAUDI ARABIAN AIRFIELD AT DHAHRAN. SOON HUGE
ANTONOV.22 TRANSPORT  PLANES WERE LANDING AT HAHRAN, UNLOADING T.72 TANKS, BMP
INFANTRY COMBAT VEHICLES, ARTILLERY, AND BM-21 "KATYUSHA" ROCKET LAUNCHERS. BY
MORNING, A LARGE PART OF A MOTOR RIFLE DIVISION, VETERANS OF DESERT COMBAT IN
AFGHANISTAN, WAS ON THE GROUND. BY THE END OF THE DAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSIAN GULF OILFIELDS WERE IN THE SOVIET HANDS.

WITHIN HOURS, C-141 STARLIFTERS CARRYING THE PARATROOPS OF THE UNITED STATES
RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE TOOK OFF FROM THEIR AIRFIELDS IN EGYPT. IN THE UNITED
STATES, C-5 GALAXIES BEGAN TAKING ON CARGOES OF  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS
AND SELF-PROPELLED GUNS. IN THE INDIAN OCEAN, A U.S.NAVY TASK FORCE, CARRYING
RDF ARMOR AND HELICOPTERS, SET A COURSE FOR THE PERSIAN GULF. 

RDF 1985, THE SECOND OF WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDE SCENARIOS, IS A
BATTALION-LEVEL  SIMULATION OF THE RESULTING BATTLE. THE RULES ARE ESSENTIALLY
THE SAME AS THOSE IN GERMANY 1985. THIS BOOKLET DESCRIBES THE EXCEPTIONS AND
THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF DESERT COMBAT THT ONLY APPLY TO RDF 1985. 

1.0 PLAYING THE FIRST GAME: 

*YOU WILL NOW BEGIN A SOLITAIRE GAME, IN WHICH YOU ARE THE AMERICAN COMMANDER,
AND THE COMPUTER PLAYS THE SOVIET COMMANDER. 

WHEN THE GAME OPTIONS DISPLAY APPERARS, HIT 3 TWICE TO REDUCE THE STRENGTH OF
THE RUSSIAN FORCE AND TO EXPOSE ALL OF THE SOVIET UNITS TO VIEW. THE RUSSIAN
UNITS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. 

PRESS THE SPACEBAR, AND THE GAME WILL BEGIN WITH AN AMERICAN AIRDROP ONTO THE
DESERT. 


1.1 THE MAP
EACH  HEXAGON OF THE  39 X 28 HEX MAP REPRESENTS 2.5 MILES. ON YOUR SCREEN,
YOU WILL SEE ONE-TWELFTH OF THE TOTAL BATTLE FIELD. A NUMBER OR A LETTER WILL
TELL WHICH SECTOR YOU ARE SEEING. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME, ALL OILFIELDS,
VILLAGES, TOWNS AND AIRFIELDS ARE RUSSIAN OWNED. IF AN AMERICAN UNIT MOVES
INTO THEM, THEY WILL BE AMERICAN OWNED, AND THE SYMBOL WILL CHANGE. THEY CAN
CHANGE OWNERSHIP ANY NUMBER OF TIMES DURING A GAME. FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE, SEE
RDF VICTORY CONDITIONS (11.0). 

1.2 MOVING THE CURSOR
TO MOVE THE BLINKING CURSOR AROUND THE MAP, TYPE THE COMMAND KEYS PICTURED IN
THE DIAGRAM BELOW:                
                      ____
                 ____/ 1  \____
                / 6  \____/ 2  \
                \____/ *  \____/ 
                / 5  \____/ 3  \
                \____/ 4  \____/ 
                     \____/   

1.3 MOVING UNITS
PRESS ESCAPE TO MOVE THE CURSOR TO THE FIRST UNIT AND TO ENTER ITS MOVEMENT
PHASE, AND THEN USE THE COMMAND KEYS TO MOVE THAT UNIT.  WHEN YOU'VE USED UP
THE MOVEMENT ALLOWENCE OF THAT UNIT, THE CURSOR WILL FIND THE NEXT MOVABLE
UNIT. WHEN YOU HAVE MOVED ALL OF YOUR UNITS, THE CURSOR WILL BLINK. PRESS
CONTROL AND E, AND THEN E TO END YOUR TURN. 

1.4 THE SOVIET MOVE
THE COMPUTER WILL MOVE ALL OF THE SOVIET UNITS. DURING THE SOVIET MOVE, YOU
CAN STOP THE COMPUTER BY TYPING ESCAPE. WHILE THE MOVE IS PAUSED, YOU CAN USE
ANY OF THE SPECIAL KEYS (12.0). TO RESUME THE SOVIET MOVE, PRESS ANY KEY. WHEN
THE SOVIET MOVE IS FINISHED, THE CURSOR WILL BEGIN TO BLINK, INDICATING THAT
THE FIRST FOUR-HOUR TURN IS OVER. PRESS ESCAPE TO MOVE YOUR FIRST UNIT AGAIN.

2.0 MOVEMENT

2.1 THE MOVEMENT DISPLAY
THE RDF MOVEMENT DISPLAY SHOWS THE WORD SMOKE; IF IT IS HIGHLIGHTED, THE MOVING UNIT IS IN A SMOKE FILLED HEX. MN(MINE) AND NC(NUMCLEAR CONTAMINATION) ARE NOT SHOWN, SINCE THEY PLAY NO PART IN THIS SCENARIO. 

2.2 AIR CAVALRY
AIR CAVALRY USES ONE MOVEMENT POINT(MP) PER HEX. IN ADDITION TO THIS, AIR
CAVALRY UNITS WILL USE: 

2 EXTRA MP'S TO ENTER A SMOKE-FILLED HEX
1 EXTRA MP FOR EACH SIGHTING ENEMY UNIT (SEU)(2 IF THE AIR UNIT IS IN TRANS MODE)
1 EXTRA MP IF THE ENEMY HAS AIR SUPERIORITY, AND THE AIR CAVALRY IS IN THE TRANS MODE. 

AIR CAVALRY UNITS CANNOT ENTER ENEMY-OWNED OILFIELD, VILLAGE, TOWN OR AIRFIELD HEXES. 

2.3 UNITS IN TRANSPORT MODE
*CAN ONLY TRAVEL THROUGH TOWN, VILLAGE AND AIRFIELD HEXES, OR ALONG THE ROADS.
*CANNOT ENTER ENEMY-OWNED OILFIELDS, TOWNS, VILLAGES AND AIRFIEDS.

2.4 BRIDGING
DUE TO AN EXCEPTIONAL LACK OF WATER IN SAUDI ARABIA'S RIVERS, NO BRIDGING IS
NECESSARY IN THIS SCENARIO. ENGINEER UNITS HAVE NO SPECIAL FUNCTIONS. 

2.5 TERRAIN
THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TERRAIN UPON MOVEMENT ARE DETAILED IN THE
TERRAIN EFFECTS TABLE IN THE APPENDIX. 

3.0 MODES ---------

3.1 SPECIAL MODE RULES
ENGINEER UNITS ARE ALLOWED TO RE-ORGANIZE. NO UNIT CAN ENTER RIVER MODE. 

4.0 THE ORDER PHASE
NAVAL UNITS CANNOT USE STATEGIC MOVEMENT. THEY CAN ONLY BE MOVED WITH THE
MOVEMENT KEYS. 

5.0 AIR POWER

5.1  THE AIR POWER DISPLAY
HIT CTRL A AT ANY TIME TO SEE AN AIR POWER DISPLAY LIKE THIS:

        NATO:3:RUSSIAN:1:  :ALC:KEYS (A)IR SUPERIORITY:SPARE.9:0 :0-9 TACTICAL
        AIR SUPPORT :6 :

    IN THIS SAMPLE, THE HIGHLIGHTED SIDE, NATO, HAS THREE-TO-ONE AIR
    SUPERIORITY DURING THIS TURN. THE NATO PLAYER MAY ALLOCATE UP TO
    9 SPARE POINTS TOWARD AIR SUPERIORITY IN THE FUTURE TURNS BY TYPING
    ANY NUMBER UP TO 9. THE NATO PLAYER MAY CALL IN UP TO 6 TACTICAL
    AIRSTRIKES DURING THIS TURN.

5.2 CALLING AIR STRIKES
IF ITS SIDE HAS AIR SUPERIORITY, AND THE AIR POWER DISPLAY SHOWS AVAILABLE
TACTICAL AIR  STRIKES, ANY UNIT CAN CALL FOR A SUPPORTING STRIKE BY: 

        *TYPING (O) FOR ITS ORDER PHASE
        *TYPING (S) FOR SUPPORT FIRE

IF A PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE AIR SUPERIORTY, HE CANNOT CALL FOR TACTICAL AIR
STRIKES DURING THAT TURN. IF THE U.S. PLAYER HAS AIR SUPERIORITY, HE WILL HAVE
BETWEEN 2 AND 7 AVAILABLE AIR STRIKES. A RUSSIAN PLAYER WITH AIR SUPERIORITY
WILL HAVE BETWEEN 0-5 STRIKES. 

5.3 AIR SUPERIORITY
*THE U.S. PLAYER HAS AIR SUPERIORITY DURING THE FIRST 2 TURNS. 

*THE RUSSIAN PLAYER STARTS THE SCENARIO WITH NO SPARE AIR POINTS, AND HE
RECEIVES FEWER POINTS THAN THE U.S PLAYER EACH TURN. IT WILL TAKE 5 OR 6 TURNS
BEFORE HE HAS ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE THE U.S. PLAYER. 

6.0 COMBAT
RUSSIAN UNITS ON COAST HEXES CAN ATTACK OR FIRE ON U.S. NAVAL UNITS, BUT THE
NAVAL UNITS CANNOT FIRE BACK AT THEM. 

6.1 ARTILLERY DAMAGE
PARA UNITS, LIKE BMP,TANK, AND APC UNITS, SUFFER GREATER DAMAGE FROM ARTILLERY
IF THEY ARE IN TRANS, ATTACK OR REOR MODE. 

6.2 RETREATING UNITS
NAVAL UNITS THAT ARE FORCED TO RETREAT AFTER COMBAT WILL SUFFER INCREASED
LOSSES INSTEAD. 

7.0 REORGANIZATION
IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RULES THE U.S PLAYER MAY USE A FRIENDLY AIRFIELD
INSTEAD OF ITS HQ (WHICHEVER IS CLOSER) FOR RE-ORGANIZATION PURPOSES. 

8.0 HIDDEN UNITS
PARA UNITS WILL BE EXPOSED DURING THE TURN THEY LAND, EVEN IF THE HIDDEN GAME
OPTION HAS BEEN CHOSEN. THEY MAY BE HIDDEN IN LATER TURNS. 

9.0 MINES AND NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION
MINES AND NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION PLAY NO PART IN THIS SCENARIO. 

10.0 REINFORCMENTS
BOTH SIDES ARE SCHEDULED TO RECIEVE REINFORCEMENTS DURING THE TURNS SHOWN ON
THE RDF DATA CARD. 

RUSSIAN REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE AT THE HEXES SHOWN ON THE DATA CARD. 

*PARA UNITS ARRIVE WITHIN 3 HEXES IF THE DROP ZONES SELECTED BY THE COMPUTER,
OR BY THE NATO PLAYER, HAS USED THE DROP ZONE PLACEMENT OPTION.(13.3). 

*PARA UNITS CANNOT LAND ON ENEMY-OWNED HEXES, OR ON THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE
MAP (SECTORS 1,4,7 OR A). 

*IF A DROP ZONE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE SEA OR THE EDGE OF THE MAP, PARA UNITS MAY
BE UNABLE TO LAND; THE ERROR SIGNAL WILL SOUND. *THE PARA DROPS ON TURN 3 AND
TURN 4 WILL BE DELAYED ONE TURN IF THE RUSSIANS HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY. 

U.S. REINFORCEMENTS  ARRIVING BY AIRPLANE (TURNS 7,8 AND 9) WILL LAND ON
AVAILABLE FRIENDLY AIRFIELDS. NO MORE THAN TWO UNITS WILL ARRIVE AT ANY FIELD
(ONE UNIT AT NIGHT). FRIENDLY UNITS ON THESE AIRFIELDS WILL HINDER THE LANDING
OF REINFORCEMENTS. RUSSIAN AIR SUPERIORITY WILL DELAY ALL AIR-LANDING
REINFORCEMENTS FOR ONE TURN. 

10.1 NAVAL UNITS
A U.S. TASK FORCE, CARRYING REINFORCEMENTS FOR THE RDF, ARRIVES IN THE PERSIAN
GULF DURING TURNS 12, 13 AND 14. 

*NAVAL UNITS ARE MOVED THE SAME WAY AS CONVENTIONAL UNITS, WITH THE DIRECTION
KEYS. 

*AT SEA, NAVAL UNTIS CANNOT ENGAGE IN COMBAT, CHANGE MODE, USE THE ORDER PHASE
OR SUPPLY SUPPORTING FIRE. 

*NAVAL UNITS ARE ASSUMED TO BE IN TRANS MODE. THEIR MOVEMENT IS REDUCED IF THE
RUSSIANS HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY, AND BY THE PRESENCE OF SIGHTING ENEMY UNITS. 

*RUSSIAN UNITS ON COAST HEXES CAN FIRE ON OR ATTACK U.S. NAVAL UNITS, BUT
CANNOT BE ATTACKED IN RETURN. 

10.2 LANDING NAVAL UNITS TO LAND, A NAVAL UNIT MUST END ITS MOVEMENT PHASE
ADJACENT TO THE COAST WHERE IT INTENDS TO LAND. ANY UNIT WHICH MOVES AT SEA
CANNOT LAND UNTIL THE NEXT MOVE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT MOVE, THE UNIT
WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE ASHORE. 

*NAVAL UNITS CANNOT LAND ON ENEMY OCCUPIED HEXES OR  ENEMY-OWNED  TOWN OR
VILLAGE HEXES. 

10.3 NAVAL UNITS ON SHORE
ONCE ASHORE, NAVAL UNITS CONVERT INTO CONVENTIONAL UNITS, WITH A REDUCED
MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE FOR THE FIRST TURN. UPON LANDING UNITS CHANGE AUTOMATICALLY
TO NORM MODE.(ARTILLERY CHANGES TO FIRE).

11.0 VICTORY CONDITIONS
THE  GAME  WILL END AFTER 21,22, OR 23 TURNS, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE
COMPUTER. THE COMPUTER WILL THEN COMPARE EACH PLAYER'S POINT TOTAL AND WILL
DECLARE A WINNER.  POINTS ARE AWARDED AS FOLLOWS:

1 POINT FOR EACH ENEMY UNIT ELIMINATED (ENEMY UNITS WHICH EXIT THE BOARD DO
  NOT COUNT)
1 POINT FOR EACH OILFIELD HEX OWNED
2 POINTS FOR EACH TOWN OR VILLAGE OWNED A PLAYER WITH 10 OR MORE POINTS THAN
  HIS OPPONENT HAS WON A DECISIVE VICTORY.

12.0 SPECIAL KEYS
THE SPECIAL KEYS CAN BE UNSED DURING YOUR OWN TURN WHEN THE CURSOR IS
FLASHING, OR, BY PRESSING ESCAPE DURING THE COMPUTERS MOVE. 

*IF THE HIDDEN OPTION WAS CHOSEN WHEN YOU SET UP THE GAME, YOU CANNOT USE THE
 D (HIGHLIGHT DIVISION) OR THE P(STRATEGIC MAP) KEYS DURING THE COMPUTER'S
 MOVE.

13.0 GAME OPTIONS

13.1 SAVING THE GAME
A GAME MAY BE SAVED AT ANY TIME ON A SECOND DISK BY HITTING CONTROL BAND
FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. RDF GAMES MAY BE SAVED ON THE SAME DISK AS GERMANY
1985 OR OTHER SCENARIOS. 

13.2 RESTARTING A GAME
TO RESTART A GAME SAVED ON ANOTHER DISK, HIT THE NUMBER OF THAT GAME OPTION
AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. THE NAMES OF GAMES AVAILABLE FOR PLAY WILL BE SHOWN
NORMALLY. HIGHLIGHTED NAMES SHOW GAMES THAT BELONG TO OTHER SCENARIOS, WHICH
CANNOT BE PLAYED WITH THE RDF DISK. 

13.3  DROP ZONE SELECTION OPTION
TO SELECT THE DROP ZONES FOR THE U.S.PARA UNITS, HIT 9 WHEN THE OPTION DISPLAY
IS SHOWN, SO THAT PLACEMENT IS HIGHLIGHTED. AS THE COMPUTER  DIRECTS, MOVE THE
CURSOR TO EACH DESIRED DROP ZONE AND PRESS RETURN. 

*PARA UNITS WILL LAND WITHIN 3 HEXES OF THE SELECTED DROP ZONES. *DROP ZONES
CANNOT BE LOCATED IN THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE MAP (SECTORS 1,4,7, OR A)

14.0 STRATEGY AND TACTICS

THE KEY TO WINNING RDF IS TAKING AND HOLDING OILFIELDS, AND EVEN MORE
IMPORTANT, AIRFIELDS. THE SOVIET PLAYER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF NUMBERS. THE U.S.
PLAYER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SUPERIOR AIR SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY ON THE FIRST DAY,
AND THE SUPERIOR TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT OF THE PARA UNITS. 

WHEN PLAYING AGAINST THE COMPUTER, REMEMBER THAT THE COMPUTER SIDE ALWAYS HAS
ENHANCED AIRPOWER AND GREATER ABILITY TO REORGANIZE, TO COMPENSATE FOR ITS
LACK OF FLEXIBILITY. IT IS ADVISABLE TO AVOID A BATTLE OF ATTRION OR HURRIED,
UNCOORDINATED OFFENSIVES, AND TO CONCENTRATE ON SHARP, WELL-SUPPORTED ATTACKS
TO ELIMINATE ENEMY UNITS. IN EFFECT, WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER, YOU
ARE PLAYING AGAINST A WELL-EQUIPPED AND WELL-TRAINED ENEMY, WITH LITTLE
IMAGINATION AND A TENDENCY TO GO STRICKLY BY THE BOOK, A TYPE OF SOLDIER
PLENTIFUL IN BOTH THE U.S. AND RED ARMY.
